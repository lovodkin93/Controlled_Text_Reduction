"Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.
""It's over.
Back to school,"" said Thomas, who won the bronze medal despite three faulty landings.
""I'm not going to make any excuses.
I was really skating well this week.
It wasn't supposed to happen, I guess.
But I tried.""
While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to music from Bizet's ""Carmen,"" Manley was so sensational in the freestyle that she finished first with seven judges.
Combined with a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the short program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley in second place.
Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became the first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold in 1948 and '52.
Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do it before Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S. figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly Saturday after doing well earlier in the Games.
By contrast, Manley had the sellout crowd at the Olympic Saddledome enraptured.
They cheered, hooted and stamped their feet when she finished hitting every element of her program.
Jill Trenary of Minnetonka, Minn., finished fourth.
She was fifth heading into the long program, worth 50 percent of the overall score.
Thomas' bronze was the third figure skating medal here for the United States.
Brian Boitano won the men's crown, and a bronze in pairs went to Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.
In addition to the three figure skating medals, the U.S. team had three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.
Speed skater Bonnie Blair, America's only double medalist, tried again Saturday in the 1,500 meters but finished fourth, well off the pace.
She won the gold in the 500 and the bronze in the 1,000 meters.
As the Olympics winded up its next-to-last day, the Soviet Union had 27 medals, including 11 golds, while East Germany in second place had 22, including nine golds.","The United States' Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold crumbled Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth Manley took home the silver.

"If the two sides trying to force changes in the 1990 census both get their way, the results would nearly balance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.
The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens from its national head count.
Traditionally, it counts everyone living in the country.
Groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats in the House of Representatives at the expense of other states.
Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to be increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census _
most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed among the states on the basis of population.
""If both sides get their way, the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,"" said William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population Reference Bureau.
O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for Northeast and Midwest members of Congress that he estimates their region will lose 14 House seats following the 1990 census.
That would continue a trend evident over the last several decades, he noted.
Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted minorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in the other would make little difference in the long run.
The only change, he said, would be that California would gain five new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two rather than just one.
""That's easy to understand, since there are so many undocumented aliens in California,"" he commented.
O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on 1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to be the big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with a gain of four and Texas adding three.
Expected to pick up one seat each are Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona.
On the other hand New York would lose three seats.
States losing two apiece would be Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.
Expected to lose one house seat are Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, West Virginia and Montana.","While there is pressure on the Census Bureau to exclude illegal aliens from its national head count, other groups urge the Bureau to adjust its final figures to account for people missed in the census--mostly minorities in urban areas.
A population expert with the Population Reference Bureau says that deleting the illegal aliens and adding an estimate of the uncounted would result in a loss of one seat for California and a gain of one seat for Georgia.
The expert also predicted that Northeast and Midwest states will lose 14 House seats following the 1990 census, continuing a trend observed for several decades.","[[162, 252], [518, 559], [576, 689], [126, 145], [955, 962], [975, 1002], [1320, 1379], [1452, 1567], [1004, 1015], [1041, 1062], [1083, 1087], [1101, 1164], [1166, 1231]]"

"A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students.
Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony.
The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner.
Law students last September began a campaign of demonstrations and vigils on the campus.
They hung a banner from the second floor of the law library that said: ""Honor Nelson Mandela.""
Before he was imprisoned, said third-year law student Sarah Ottinger, ""Nelson Mandela was an ... attorney and an activist who worked against apartheid.
That's the message we wanted conveyed to students.""
South Africa's white-minority government says it will free Mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country.
Some faculty members and students, including many blacks, have criticized the administration's plan for the event, saying no effort was made to include them.
""I don't even know what office is sponsoring it,"" said Keith Motley, dean and director of the African-American Institute, a student group.
""We got a memo from the administration saying they need six ushers, but that's it.""
""You'd think at least we'd be clued in to what's going on.""
""This started out as something noble, something we've tried to have done for three years,"" said Ottinger.
""We are very, very sorry it happened this way.
It wasn't meant to turn out like this.""
The trustees decided in January that Mandela should get the honorary degree.
Students set up a committee to contact Mandela's family to get their approval.
University spokesman Paul Jones said letters were sent to Mandela's wife, Winnie, and his two daughters: Zenani, a student at Boston University, and Makaziwe, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.

"Here are excerpts of the speech to the Security Council on Thursday by Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati of Iran, delivered in Farsi and translated by the Iranian Mission:
In the morning of Sunday July 2, 1988, families and friends of 290 passengers and crew said farewell to their loved ones in Tehran and Bandar Abbas airports _ unaware of the dastardly attack that awaited them, unaware of the tragic destiny that would be imposed upon them by a reckless and incompetent naval force led by aggressive and expansionist policy-makers.
According to the transcript of the communication between the pilot and Bandar Abbas tower, before permission for takeoff was granted the tower asked the pilot to make sure that his transponder was turned on.
Positive response from the pilot was received.
The plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the internationally established and published Amber 59 airway that is used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two airports.
The plane was then climbing to the prescribed altitude at about 320 knots per hour.
Seconds after the last communication between the plane and the tower, the plane was targeted by two surface-to-air Standard guided missiles from USS Vincennes, the most technologically sophisticated naval ship. ...
The plane ws shot when it was at the center line of Amber 59 airway.
USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai.
Another story which was fabricated to misguide the international public opinion was the claim by the United States that the airliner was not transmitting the appropriate signals.
Adm. Crowe claimed on July 3, 1988: ""There were electronic indications on Vincennes that led it to believe that the aircraft was an F-14.""
Notwithstanding the fact that the Iranian air force had no F-14 operations in the morning of that unfortunate Sunday in or around the Strait of Hormuz, it may be noted that the military experts well-familiar with F-14 and its capabilities have held that F-14 could not have presented any serious danger to the USS Vincennes or any surface target for that matter.
F-14 fighters, as it should be known most vividly to the Americans who made them, are designed for air-to-air attack and not air-to-surface operations.
Possibly the most fallacious argument of the American officials in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the warship.
While every available evidence including the transcripts read earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency civilian frequency.
Furthermore, because the ship failed to identify the target of its alleged warnings, the pilot of the airliner of a scheduled flight should not have reasonably taken it as directed against himself.
Finally, the most awkward American explanation for shooting down a civilian airliner was presented by Adm. Crowe, who claimed that the plane was coming onto the USS Vincennes in a war zone, while descending and increasing speed of 450 miles an hour.
It is necessary to note that the area where the plane was attacked is well outside the declared war zones of the combatants.
This fact is attested to even by Lloyd's of London.
The question that needs to be asked is why a warship had positioned itself right at the center of a civilian airway.
Furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the Vincennes.
All available evidence suggest(s) that the shooting down of an Iranian civil airliner ... could not have been a mistake.
Certainly the huge difference in appearance, size, weight, and flight pattern between an Airbus and those of an F-14, whic is almost a fourth of the former, would make any claim of mistaken identity absurd.
Rather, the course of events during that day clearly shows that the U.S. warships in the area had clear aggressive intentions, which resulted in the massacre of 290 innocent people.","The Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati, spoke to the Security Council of the United Nations and gave the Iranian version of the shooting down of an Iranian commercial Airbus.
He said that all available evidence shows that the disaster could not have been caused by a mistake by the crew of the Vincennes.
The huge difference between the configuration of an airbus and a fighter renders absurd any claim of mistaken identity.
He belittled such explanations by the United States, and said that it was evident the warship took an aggressive course and caused the massacre of 200 innocent people.","[[25, 55], [71, 114], [3846, 3892], [4017, 4023], [25, 31], [68, 114], [3792, 3805], [3807, 3926], [3938, 4044], [4091, 4133], [464, 487], [2141, 2205], [2415, 2460], [2889, 2927], [3084, 3112], [3345, 3421], [3696, 3771], [4096, 4133], [4143, 4153], [4203, 4295], [4300, 4315]]"
"Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying ""nationalist passions"" benefit opponents of his reforms.
The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country, due in part to ""active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.""
""Perestroika,"" or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change.
State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh district has led to mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence since February.
The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervened July 18.
It rejected any change in Nagorno-Karabakh's status but called for measures to develop the region's economy and culture.
The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist Party chief in March 1985.
He indicated Friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis.
Gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, the party's policy-making body.
A summary of his remarks was distributed by the official Tass news agency.
Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a ""current aggravation"" of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said.
Among the causes, Gorbachev listed ""a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.""
Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that ""nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces,"" he suggested increasing accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife.
Tass did not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion.
At the July 18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive.
Gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says the law can punish ""any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt.""
Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on ""equal use"" of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions.
In particular, the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs.
The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, will face criminal charges following an incident in which activists seeking the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh attached slogans to their cars and drove around the city.
The paper did not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration, but said 155 drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined.
In its July 18th decision, the Presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the Caucasus Mountain region.
Tass reported Friday that the situation was stabilizing in Armenia, but said that at the ""urging of instigators,"" some strikes and protests were continuing.","The six-month conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagoro-Karabakh, an enclave of Armenians of Armenians living within Azerbaijan, is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became president.

"An annual Agriculture Department survey confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come.
However, government officials said bountiful crops in recent years has built stockpiles so high the United States need not fear actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting food.
The report came hours after President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion relief bill that he acknowledged won't bring rain to crops already sweltering, but hopefully will help farmers survive to plant again next spring.
The new surveys led USDA experts to predict the 1988 corn crop will total 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from last year's harvest and the smallest output since 1983.
Sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans, wheat and a number of other crops.
Cotton, which thrived last month in the hot, humid weather, is expected to increase from last year.
Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put total U.S. crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average, a scale used to compare output from year to year.
That matched the low 1983 reading, when sharp cutbacks in government acreage programs, along with drought, reduced crop production sharply.
The corn crop is expected to average 78.5 bushels per harvested acre, down from 119.4 bushel per acre last year, a record year-to-year decline of 34 percent.
Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production of meat, poultry and dairy products.
Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chief economist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food this year, 2 percent next year.
""Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major impact on this year's crops,"" Wilson told reporters.
""But because of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases to assure and adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign customers and meet our food-aid commitments.""
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in a statement, ""Today's crop report confirms our fears about the impacts of this summer's tragic drought.
Fortunately, it appears we will have enough stocks to make it through this marketing year.""
The USDA's grim news came hours after President Reagan on Thursday signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping drought-stricken farmers recover.
""This bill isn't as good as rain,"" Reagan said to the nation's farmers.
""But it will tide you over until normal weather and your own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role.""
The new USDA crop estimates were based on field surveys as of Aug. 1.
In May and June, before drought had made its biggest impact, USDA projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and an assumption of normal weather _
at 7.3 billion bushels.
But those projections were revised downward a month ago to 5.2 billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the season.
The soybean harvest was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year.
Prospects last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July projection was 1.65 billion bushels.
Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels, down 13 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987.
In May and June, the USDA forecast this year's output would be up slightly.
The July projection was 1.84 billion bushels The wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall, which barely stayed ahead of the drought.
Later plantings of durum and other spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness.
Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last year.
But durum and the other spring varieties, which are produced in the hard-hit northern plains, showed sharp declines.
Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percent from last year's harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212 million bushels, down 53 percent from 1987.
Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1 percent from last year.
The crop was projected at 13.7 billion bales in July.
Department officials said U.S. grain production this year is expected to total 192 million metric tons, 31 percent smaller than the 1987 output.
The total grain supply for 1988-89 _ which includes inventories on hand at the beginning of the season _ is down 24 percent from last season.
In addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields, Wilson said production of some other spring-planted crops has suffered, including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288 million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million bushels, down 24 percent.
Wilson said USDA experts ""continue to believe that the drought will add only one percentage point"" to consumer food prices this year.
The department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3 percent to 5 percent.
Before the heat and dry weather, USDA had expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer price index for food next year.
""That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,"" Wilson said.
""So this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.""
He also said the United States is ""looking at an export situation that is not as good as it was a year ago.""
He said production abroad would have to take up the slack in world food supply caused by the drought.
""Our figures here today would indicate that food production in other countries has not been cut that much,"" he said.
There remained a possibility that the United States would import some soybeans this year, Wilson said.
He scoffed at any suggestion, however, that the United States may have lost its capacity to produce sizeable crop surpluses.
He noted that 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production this year in addition to millions of additional acres in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
Meanwhile, USDA weatherman Norton Strommen said rain in the midcontinent in recent days has not meant an end to the drought.
""The drought, as you can see, is still basically with us throughout the entire United States,"" Strommen said.","President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping drought- stricken farmers.
Harvests of corn, wheat, soybeans, oats, barley and sorghum are predicted to be down 24 to 45 percent from last year.

In addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields, Wilson said production of some other spring-planted crops has suffered, including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288 million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million bushels, down 24 percent.
Wilson said USDA experts ""continue to believe that the drought will add only one percentage point"" to consumer food prices this year.
The department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3 percent to 5 percent.
Before the heat and dry weather, USDA had expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer price index for food next year.
""That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,"" Wilson said.
""So this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.""
He also said the United States is ""looking at an export situation that is not as good as it was a year ago.""
He said production abroad would have to take up the slack in world food supply caused by the drought.
""Our figures here today would indicate that food production in other countries has not been cut that much,"" he said.
There remained a possibility that the United States would import some soybeans this year, Wilson said.
He scoffed at any suggestion, however, that the United States may have lost its capacity to produce sizeable crop surpluses.
He noted that 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production this year in addition to millions of additional acres in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
Meanwhile, USDA weatherman Norton Strommen said rain in the midcontinent in recent days has not meant an end to the drought.
""The drought, as you can see, is still basically with us throughout the entire United States,"" Strommen said.","President Reagan has signed a $3.9 billion drought relief bill on Thursday.
The annual Agriculture Department survey released hours later predicted total crop production will be 88% of the 1977 average, with grain production 31% smaller than the 1987 harvest.
Corn, the largest and most important American crop, will decline 34% from last year.
The soybean harvest is expected to be down 23%, with all wheat production dropping 13%.
The department had already predicted that food prices would increase about 4% and believes this drought will add about 1 to 2% more.
Food stockpiles, however, remain high and 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production.","[[50, 58], [438, 488], [3, 39], [410, 437], [1038, 1102], [4299, 4315], [4372, 4411], [1298, 1302], [1308, 1322], [1416, 1450], [1452, 1456], [1460, 1521], [3088, 3121], [3147, 3162], [3319, 3342], [3382, 3397], [5096, 5115], [5121, 5162], [5171, 5207], [253, 258], [275, 278], [285, 295], [299, 303], [5997, 6051]]"
"Dan Quayle's sister believes the Indiana senator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.
""I don't think it will be tough on the family,"" said Martha Saddler, Quayle's sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind. ""Since he's been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic schedule and wonder how he does it.
But he does it and loves it.""
The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.
Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life.
Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as law students in Indianapolis, married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period.
""One of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit,"" said Indianapolis attorney William R. Neale, treasurer of Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign.
""He's the same nice guy he was in law school.""
Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.
Dan Quayle, who grew up in Huntington, graduated from DePauw University, a small liberal arts college in Greencastle, Ind., before going to work in the Indiana attorney general's office in 1970.
Daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, said he doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him.
""I think his strength is he'll remember who his friends are even after this,"" said Evans, who was chairman of Quayle's 1986 campaign.
Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington.
""His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to,"" said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute.
""It's a beautiful family.
I think they'll be a real asset.""
The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne.
When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in two groups _
the boys riding in parades with Marilyn Quayle and Corinne and her father visiting county fairs.
""The kids are nonchalant, normal kids,"" said Mrs. Saddler.
""They take it in stride and play.""
In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the family's loss of privacy during a national campaign.
""The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,"" said Mrs. Quayle, 39.
Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.
Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said.
Benjamin was ambiguous
but he thought Secret Service agents might be able to help him on tests at school, Mrs. Quayle said.
Corinne didn't like the prospect of having her father spend more time away from home, Quayle said.
""She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks Bob Dole,""' said Quayle.","Relatives and friends of Republican Vice Presidential candidate Dan Quayle do not believe that his candidacy will have an adverse effect on his family life.

"Police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake that killed at least 731 people in India and Nepal.
Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible since Sunday's devastating quake.
Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday, while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders the size of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys.
At least 531 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa, additional secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry.
Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan, one of the hardest-hit towns, and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and five-story houses.
""This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,"" Shrestha said as he toured the town.
India reported an official death toll of 200, but the figure was disputed by news media and opposition politicians who put the Indian death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.
In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milk and coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction.
Women dressed in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in the quake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and present their offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in the Hindu trinity.
""If God is pleased, nothing will happen,"" said one woman, who refused to give her name.
The earthquake, which struck shortly before daybreak Sunday when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale.
It was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain at the base of a steep hill.
At least 131 bodies have been found in the town of 100,000.
Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.
Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation.
""We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied (the ones remaining) are safe to live in,"" he said.
British soldiers from a nearby Gurkha recruiting center pitched in with cranes to aid the demolition.
Dharan is in the heart of regional famed for fierce Gurkha fighters who have served in the British army for more than 150 years.
Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes were demolished.
Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors of found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.
The hardest hit areas in India were in Bihar state just across the Nepalese border.
Rescuers in army helicopters searched for survivors in Bihar's Darbhanga, Madhubani and Mungar districts.
Other helicopters ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police trapped in the most remote regions of Bihar, India's poorest state.
Heavy rains, overflowing rivers and submerged bridges and roads hampered attempts by 1,000 Indian soldiers to provide assistance.
In Nepal, 88-pound bags of rice were being distributed to families affected by the quake, but officials were unable to give any figures.
International agencies operating in Nepal were gearing up to contribute supplies or assistance but have not yet heard from the government on what was wanted, according to several foreign relief workers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Shrestha said the mountain kingdom had not sought foreign aid because ""we are still assessing the magnitude of the tragedy.""

"The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among non-smokers, according to a study published Friday.
While no direct link has been established between smoking and leukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showed that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers.
For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, and for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed.
""If the findings in our study represented a direct relationship between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto established causes combined,"" said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh.
Kinlen conducted the study of 248,000 U.S. military veterans with E. Rogot, a statistician at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.
They wrote that it was ""the largest study of leukemia and smoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence that leukemia is a smoking-related disease.""
In an editorial in the prestigious weekly, Professor Nicholas Wald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no cause-and-effect relationship had been established.
But he added: ""Whatever the mechanism, the balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia.""
It should therefore be added to the World Heath Organization's list of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote.
The study was conducted on data collected from 248,000 veterans between 1954 and 1969, the researchers wrote.
During that period 723 died of leukemia.
Of these 330 were cigarette smokers, 185 were ex-smokers, 46 smoked cigars or and 162 were non-smokers.
The study found that in some types of leukemia, the death rate among smokers was sharply higher than the average.
Thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokers of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, compared with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias.
For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10 cigarettes, 40 percent higher.
When the data was broken down into smokers and ex-smokers, it suggested that ex-smokers also are significantly more at risk.
The death rate among smokers was 53 percent higher, and among ex-smokers 39 percent.","A study conducted by Dr. Leo Kinlen of the University of Edinburgh and E. Rogot of the US National Institutes of Health shows that smokers are more likely to die from monocytic and myeloid leukemias than are non-smokers.
The data also suggested that even ex-smokers are significantly more at risk than those who never smoked.
Professor Wald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no cause-and-effect had been established but, he added, ""the balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia.""

"With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center, reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on Tuesday.
Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
""That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere,"" Zimmer said.
The previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he said.
With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one of the largest.
But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably about half that size, Moore said.
Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records.
The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, however.
That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8 and killed more than 6,000 people.
Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet.
The storm surge _
a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path _ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.
Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _
shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and windows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.
""Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,"" Zimmer said.
""The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air in the center.
If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then you can have a severe hurricane.""
Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90.
The weakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of 74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.","Hurricane Gilbert, a Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph and the lowest barometric pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, may be the most intense hurricane ever recorded.
Although records of geographical size are not kept, it may also be the largest.
The other two are Hurricane Camille in 1969 that bulldozed the Mississippi coast with a 28 foot wave, leaving 1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead, and the Labor Day storm of 1935.
Still, the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, killing more than 6000 people, was a hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas on Sept. 8, 1900.","[[1156, 1166], [1185, 1202], [0, 65], [18, 35], [434, 500], [80, 171], [794, 829], [912, 953], [1277, 1387], [1406, 1473], [1475, 1638]]"
"With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center, reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on Tuesday.
Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
""That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere,"" Zimmer said.
The previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he said.
With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one of the largest.
But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably about half that size, Moore said.
Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records.
The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, however.
That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8 and killed more than 6,000 people.
Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet.
The storm surge _
a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path _ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.
Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _
shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and windows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.
""Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,"" Zimmer said.
""The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air in the center.
If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then you can have a severe hurricane.""
Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90.

It has been compared to the Labor Day, 1935 hurricane in the Florida Keys, which killed 408, and Camille, which struck Mississippi in 1969, killing 256.","[[3, 20], [702, 751], [761, 762], [3, 20], [44, 49], [60, 80], [3, 20], [1500, 1517], [3, 20], [165, 210], [224, 236], [288, 382], [92, 137], [127, 151], [525, 557], [2382, 2388], [2578, 2603], [2382, 2388], [2509, 2515], [2528, 2548], [1374, 1377], [1476, 1499], [1520, 1543], [1636, 1695], [1704, 1757], [1821, 1830], [1838, 1839], [1735, 1815], [1838, 1860], [1873, 1878], [1882, 1887], [1896, 1901]]"
"Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3 million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140 miles inland from Matamoros.
At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescue mission around midnight, a judicial police officer said.
Several buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more were feared drowned.
The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early today it had been raining for more than 24 hours.
A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in the driving rain and its two occupants were missing, the local newspaper El Norte said.
Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis courts and jogging trails have been built along the river in the last few years.
Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capital of Nuevo Leon state.
The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.
The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a week Friday afternoon.
The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a sparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas, weather reports said.
Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides after it barreled into Mexico.
Earlier in the week, Gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in the Yucatan Peninsula.
The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one in Texas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras.
However, the death toll is expected to rise.
In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, the storm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin shack homes on the evacuated beachfront.
About 5,000 people were evacuated inland.
Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville.
Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications and supplies today.
At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude 25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of Brownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the National Hurricane Center in Florida.
Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.
The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the storm with up to 20 inches locally.
Flash floods were likely, it said.
The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expected to follow that track through midday today before turning gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.
In Matamoros, officials said the worst part of the storm appeared to have passed.
""Up to now the damages are not considered very grave,"" said Jose Inez Gonzalez, a Matamoros government spokesman.
Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of people in shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended.
Gilbert hit Soto la Marina, a town of 8,000 people 20 miles inland from La Pesca on late Friday, its mayor told The Associated Press by telephone.
""There is considerable material damage to the town.
It is still raining very hard,"" said Mayor Ruben Hinojosa Cortina.
""We will just have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey the situation.""
Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca were sheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had not been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.
The Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small mountain range between Monterrey and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength, said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center.
Zimmer expected the last of hurricane-force winds today.
But he predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides.
The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food, medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites in the Yucatan.
In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinking water, electrical power, gasoline and communications since Wednesday.","Although Hurricane Gilbert had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides after it reentered Mexico on Friday.
After more than 24 hours of rain, the Santa Catarina River overflowed its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros.
The police officers were on a rescue mission around midnight when they died.

"Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today ""in a complete state of shock,"" accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal.
The prize went to American Carl Lewis.
Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field.
""Everybody uses drugs,"" said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone.
""Give me a break ... they have everything.
Human blood hormone, all kinds of drugs.
Steroids is nothing anymore.
It is just an itty-bitty drug.
You can get it anywhere.""
Red-eyed and visibly distraught, Johnson's sister, Clare Rodney in suburban Toronto, refused to believe the accusation.
""If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again, my brother is not on drugs,"" she said.
Two tests of Johnson's urine sample proved positive and his denials of drug use were rejected today.
Neither a spiked sarsparilla in his track bag, as his coach suggested, nor a switched sample at the lab could have accounted for the levels of steroids found in the tests, officials said.
In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, Johnson, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days.
The world's fastest human also was automatically suspended from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's national team for life.
""He appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not comprehending the situation,"" said Canada's chief of mission, Carol Anne Letheren.
""Ben was not able to discuss or articulate anything at that moment ...
He was just not able to speak and it was a very difficult moment for all of us.""
A few hours later, he fled to the airport and boarded a plane to New York's Kennedy International Airport.
Once there, he made his way through a crush of reporters without comment as some spectators applauded.
He took a limousine to LaGuardia Airport for a flight to his Toronto home.
""This is a blow for the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement,"" said International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
In Canada, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the scandal was a ""personal tragedy for Ben and his family.
It's also a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.""
James Worrall, a Canadian member of the IOC, said Johnson ""has been killed"" as an athlete.
He said the sprinter's once-favored status as a hero to many sports fans in Canada, his native Jamaica, and around the world now will be tarnished.
Johnson's name will go down in Olympic history with other athletes who lost their gold medals, such as decathlete Jim Thorpe in 1912 because he played semi-pro baseball and swimmer Rick DeMont in 1972 because he took an asthma medicine.
Lewis did not gloat over his rival's fall.
""I feel sorry for Ben and for the Canadian people,"" he said today.
""Ben is a great competitor and I hope he is able to straighten out his life and return to competition.""
He said he did not want ""to fuel this controversy"" by commenting further.
After Saturday's race, though, Lewis had said he couldn't understand how Johnson could run as fast as he did after looking tired in qualifying heats.
Lewis has previously alleged widespread drug use in track and field.

Before his illness, Hirohito was taking about 1,300 calories daily, the official said.
The emperor complains of fatigue but does not appear to be in pain, he said.
Crown Princess Michiko, Hirohito's daughter-in-law, scaled down celebrations for her 54th birthday Thursday, canceling a traditional birthday news conference, another palace official said.
She planned a quiet gathering with members of the imperial family, the official said.","Over several hours on Thursday Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60 to 112 over 50 and his pulse dropped from 104 per minute to 84, according to Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Maeda said the emperor's blood pressure has returned to its normal level, but that the intestinal hemorrhaging that began a month ago resumed Thursday and the pace of the discharges was quickening.
Hirohito, 87, has been bedridden for a month.
He has received nearly 22 pints of blood since his illness worsened Sept. 19.
A palace source said he gets 600-700 calories a day, intravenously.","[[0, 33], [44, 51], [60, 68], [318, 408], [410, 443], [459, 464], [481, 497], [505, 537], [567, 626], [1007, 1049], [1064, 1181], [118, 121], [129, 136], [168, 176], [258, 268], [1013, 1055], [1183, 1266], [1471, 1550], [1558, 1573]]"
"More than 100 people were feared drowned after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern Bangladesh, police said today.
Fifteen bodies were recovered and 94 people were reported missing in the sinking Wednesday night where the Ilisha and Tetulia rivers meet and join the Meghna, police and a district administrator said.
Another ferry was attacked by river pirates near Chandpur late Tuesday, police said.
Six passengers, including a pregnant woman, were thrown overboard and have not been found, Chandpur police said.
About 200 passengers were wounded when the pirates fired rifles and hurled homemade bombs before making off with about $83,000 in local currency, police said.
The ferry that sank was carrying more than double its authorized capacity of 100 passengers, police said.
They said about 100 people on the ferry's roof swam to safety but most of those in the hull were unable to save themselves.
The ferry was traveling from Mehendiganj to the island town of Bhola, about 68 miles southeast of Dhaka, when it sank in 22 feet of water.
Police said six bodies were found in the hull of the ferry, the M.L. Sonali, and nine others were found more than a mile downstream.
Two independent newspapers in Dhaka, Ittefaq and Sangbad, quoted survivors as saying the ferry went out of control while trying to negotiate a turn.
The pirate attack on the second ferry, the M.V. Sagar, also occurred on the Meghna River.
The Sagar was en route from Dhaka to Barisal when about 50 pirates launched their attack near Chandpur, 34 miles southeast of Dhaka.
The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said.
The attackers escaped in waiting boats, the police added.

"Michael Dukakis' long-time support for tighter government controls on handguns provided ample ammunition for George Bush and the National Rifle Asociation.
Dukakis, who supports a federal seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases and a ban on ""Saturday Night Specials,"" accused his opponent of distorting his stance on gun control.
""I've always supported the right of hunters and sportsmen to own weapons and (for) people to protect themselves in their own homes,"" the Democrat said.
Dukakis backed the so-called Brady amendment to impose a uniform, mandatory seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases in all states.
Bush opposed the Brady amendment, which went down to a 228-182 defeat Sept. 13 after intense lobbying by the NRA.
Bush, a lifetime member of the NRA, elicited cheers from crowds across the South and West whenever he declared his opposition to new federal gun controls.
""I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, (I) like to do it, and I don't believe we need the federal government going forward with gun control legislation,"" Bush told a rally in Billings, Mont.
In opposing a federal waiting period, Bush found himself on the opposite side of several national police organizations, worried about the vagaries of state laws.
Only 22 states now bar instant gun purchases.
Dukakis vehemently denied ever telling a gun owners' lobbyist, ""I don't believe in people owning guns, only the police and military.
And I am going to do everything I can to disarm this state.""
In 1976, Dukakis supported a Massachusetts referendum to ban private ownership of handguns.
The referendum failed.
Dukakis currently favors the ban on Saturday Night Specials, as well as ""additional efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the criminally or mentally dangerous, including background checks.""
Dukakis boasts that as governor he supported a law setting a mandatory one-year prison sentence for those illegally carrying a gun, and stiffened penalties for felonies commited with a firearm.
He says 22,000 Americans are killed each year with handguns.
At one point the Dukakis campaign threatened a lawsuit against the NRA over ads berating the Democrat's record on guns and crime.
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, long a favorite of the NRA, came to the defense of his running mate, saying, ""I saw those ads about Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you.
I sure wouldn't be running with any fellow if I thought he was going to take my shotgun away from me.""
Bush said he supports ""mandatory sentences for those caught using a gun during a crime.""
But in a letter to the NRA, the Republican attacked what he called the ""gun control myths.""
""Those who invent these myths threaten more than the rights of our 70 million gun owners and 25 million hunters,"" Bush said.
""Federal licensing, gun registration, background checks, or a ban on firearms to name a few, would only restrict the rights of the law-abiding, leaving criminals free to commit crimes with illegal weapons.""
Dukakis told a crowd in Pueblo, Colo., that the charges he is against gun ownership are ""a lot of baloney.""
""What I'm concerned about is teen-agers in major cities of this country running around with Uzis and AK-47s (automatic military weapons) and killing people"" in street gangs and drug deals, Dukakis said.
""That's the kind of thing that's got to be controlled, not innocent sportsmen who have a perfect right to hunt.""
Bush, as a congressman from Houston, voted for the original federal Gun Control Act of 1968.
That law, enacted after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., barred convicted felons from buying or owning guns and banned interstate and mail-order sale of handguns.
But Bush says he also supported the 1986 McClure-Volkmer Act that allowed the interstate sale of rifles and shotguns.
Bush, in his campaign literature, says, ""I have always opposed federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.""
But he added, ""We must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the rights of society. ...
We must do all we can to keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals.""
In a debate with other Republican candidates before the Gun Owners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2, Bush said, ""I'm not only a hunter but I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.
I do have a deep appreciation for the Second Amendment rights"" to keep and bear arms.","Mike Dukakis' effort to tighten government controls on handguns provided ammunition for Rep. George Bush and the NRA in the 1988 presidential election against Dukakis.
Although Dukakis supported the Brady Bill, a 7-day wait for gun purchases, and a ban on Saturday Night Specials, he said he is not against guns for sports and protection.
Bush, as a presidential candidate and a lifetime member of the NRA, opposed new federal gun controls, although he voted for federal laws in 1968 as a congressman.
Dukakis says 22,000 Americans are killed yearly by handguns; Bush says...""I have a deep appreciation for Second Amendment rights.""","[[0, 15], [27, 87], [94, 154], [488, 506], [517, 544], [564, 609], [156, 163], [169, 177], [238, 271], [337, 447], [469, 486], [739, 773], [739, 743], [838, 892], [3393, 3415], [3430, 3439], [3453, 3484], [1982, 2041], [4181, 4190], [4253, 4314]]"
"Illinois Power Co. has agreed to pay $11.5 million to a couple critically injured in a natural-gas explosion in their home two years ago.
In a settlement reached Monday, the utility company agreed to pay Jerry Sickmeier, 33, and Lisa Jines, 26, $10 million in damages and $1.5 million for medical expenses, said the couple's attorney, C.E. Heiligenstein.
Both sustained burns on over 80 percent of their bodies in the Dec. 7, 1986, explosion at their home in Cahokia, a St. Louis suburb.
They now live in nearby Belleville.
The settlement was reached on the day a trial in the case was scheduled to begin.
""They are much relieved that this financial ordeal is over with and that they can have some lifetime financial security,"" Heiligenstein said.
""Both suffered severe burns and have severe limitations in the limbs.""
Heiligenstein said neither has worked since the explosion.
Illinois Power spokeswoman Barbara Lillyman said the utility had no comment on the settlement.
The couple alleged that Illinois Power was negligent when it allowed a natural-gas pipe to deteriorate to the point that it ruptured.
Gas from the pipe traveled through sewer lines into the home's utility room and was ignited by the pilot light of a hot-water heater, they said.
The explosion occurred as police were awakening area residents and telling them to evacuate.
Sickmeier was treated for seven months at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for third-degree burns that covered most of his body.
He also suffered burns in his lungs and spent more than two months on a respirator.","Jerry Sickmeier and Lisa Jines were critically injured in a natural-gas explosion in their suburban St. Louis home Dec 7, 1986.

""The best thing to do is to sit down and have them all put it on the record and then sift through what happened and see if anything needs to be done.""

His father died years ago after being struck by a car.","[[208, 224], [509, 553], [4, 51], [1655, 1678], [509, 514], [559, 601], [615, 625], [631, 638], [294, 343], [677, 707], [1565, 1593], [2026, 2037], [2068, 2073], [2121, 2126], [2200, 2211], [56, 66], [83, 95], [107, 132], [327, 335], [351, 430], [463, 489], [137, 193], [2270, 2291], [2308, 2335]]"
"Children whose families escaped the horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and a pistol bearing the word ""victory.""
After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland Elementary School where they died.
Two others had been dragged by teachers inside to a classroom, but also died.
Twenty-nine other pupils were wounded, along with a teacher.
""There was shooting all over.
...
I was scared,"" said sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire.
""Everybody was crying in my class.""
Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds before he shot himself to death.
Afterward, a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body.
The word ""victory"" was written on the pistol handle.
Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began outside the wood-and-stucco school building.
Her teacher told students to get under their desks.
The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was that the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were firing their miniature cannon again.
But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the scream of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank.
""I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in Stockton,"" said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of Stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school.
""It's always in some other town, some other place.
It's a shock to my senses.
I don't think it's even hit me as hard as it's going to.
You don't know whether to be excited, or confused or what.""
Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their children.
""Why here?"" said Jeff Russell, 37, who was born and reared in the neighborhood.
""This has always been a sleepy little town.
(The shooting) put us back on the map.""
Lutheran and Baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood of ranch-style homes, postage-stamp lawns and streets lined with sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150,000 people 60 miles southeast of San Francisco.
The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the Pacific is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes there.
But the city has been changing with the influx of Southeast Asian refugees.
When school officials called clergy to console grieving families, Buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with their white-collared Christian counterparts.
About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are of Southeast Asian descent, said John Klose, spokesman for the Stockton School District.
The five children who were killed were Vietnamese and Cambodian.
""This is one of our best neighborhood schools,"" Klose said.
""Of all of our schools that I would think of something like this happening, this would be the last one I would think of.""
Across the street, Sarah Abbott stood astride her bicycle and gazed at the school where she graduated ""many years ago.""
The professional nanny said she was at the house of her 97-year-old grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his car on fire before starting to shoot.

"A partial solar eclipse visible across western North America bored scientists but thrilled crowds that were able to see it despite clouds covering parts of the region.
""It's fabulous to know this is actually taking place.
It's very fascinating,"" said Edie Lurie, an employee at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where dozens used solar telescopes to watch the moon eclipse 37 percent of the sun at 9:50 a.m.
PST Tuesday.
As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial eclipse, it was possible to see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun.
Also visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday and Tuesday produced major solar flares _
eruptions of heat and radiation _ including the largest since 1984.
Clouds over downtown Salt Lake City dashed Hansen Planetarium's plans to set up telescopes to watch the moon block 36 percent of the sun at 11:10 a.m. MST.
""It's a bummer, but that's the way it goes,"" planetarium spokesman Patrick Wiggins said.
The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to Dallas and Chicago.
Views were best farther west and north.
In sunny Los Angeles, 600 schoolchildren and at least 400 other people watched the eclipse at Griffith Observatory through telescopes and other devices equipped with filters to prevent eye injury.
""There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,"" observatory Director Ed Krupp said.
Most astronomers were unimpressed, saying they were waiting for a total solar eclipse that will sweep across Hawaii, the Pacific Ocean, lower Baja California in Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Brazil on July 11, 1991.
""You can see a partial eclipse every three or four years,"" said Caltech astrophysicist Ken Libbrecht.
""They're not that exciting.
A total eclipse is exciting.""
In Tucson, dozens of citizens peered through telescopes on the University of Arizona mall to see the moon eclipse 23 percent of the sun at 10:55 a.m.
MST, but 90 solar scientists stayed inside, attending a five-day conference titled ""The Sun in Time.""
""That's partly my fault,"" said conference co-organizer Mark Giampapa, an astronomer at the National Solar Observatory.
""I should have listed it in the program: `Partial eclipse, presented by God.""'
In Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m.
AST, the eclipse was watched by 26 students from Bartlett High School, several people wearing welders helmets as filters and Providence Hospital workers who ended a staff meeting early to see the spectacle.
Clouds parted long enough to allow a glimpse of the eclipse for 100 people outside the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in often rainy Portland.
""Typical Oregon astronomy
,"" said amateur astronomer Dan Dunn.
""You always have to deal with the clouds.""
Scientists had warned against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or filters.
Alan MacRobert of Sky &amp; Telescope magazine said 245 eye injuries were reported in the United States after an eclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984 partial eclipse.","A partial solar eclipse was visible across western North America on Tuesday morning.

The ""statement of solidarity with Anderson"" is from ""the leading freedom of expression organizations in the Western world,"" Anne Nelson, executive director of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, said Monday.
Ms. Nelson said she also will read the statement Thursday at the National Press Club in Washington during a news conference announcing her group's ""annual attacks-on-the-press report.""
A speech by Vice President Dan Quayle on freedom of the press is scheduled at the Press Club later Thursday.

Other organizations urging publication of the anniversary statement are: Article 19 of London; International Federation of Publishers in Paris; the International Federation of Journalists in Brussels; Index on Censorship in London; and Observatoire de L'Information in France.
In a separate letter to its members, the 150,000-member International Federation of Journalists said: ""On March 16, another shameful date in the calendar passes _ the fourth anniversary of captivity for American journalist Terry Anderson, who is held hostage in Beirut.""
The IFJ asked its members in 37 nations to draw attention to the plight of British journalist John McCarthy, who marked his 1,000th day of captivity on Jan. 10.
The IFJ said it will place advertisements in Beirut newspapers to urge the release of all hostages.
IFJ members also were urged to send letters requesting diplomatic initiatives to the ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, Syria and Iran and to ""publicize the plight of the journalists"" in union journals and national media.
In London, IFJ Secretary General Aidan White will be accompanied by McCarthy's girlfriend, Gill Morell, and several trade union leaders when they meet with U.S. Embassy officials.
Elsewhere, Charles Dale, the president of the Newspaper Guild of the United States and Canada, will lead a delegation to the U.S. State Department in Washington on Thursday.

Academy members are acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee, in violation of the rules.
Secretaries, spouses and friends, several Academy members say, are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition.
""It's like a local election of judges,"" said Academy member Harry Clein, who said he's witnessed team voting.
""A lot of people don't know who the candidates are.
So they take a look at who's around them and see what the consensus is.""
""As far as elections go, it's not bad.
But I've never been through an election in Argentina.""
Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots.
""All we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been returned,"" he said.
""Members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves.""
More than 4,600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st Annual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
Academy members vote on their area of specialty.
The Academy's actors branch, for example, is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories.
Since the voting is done secretly _
members do not sign their ballots _
the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number, Lyle said.
Ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category, and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied, he said.
Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of Academy members.
All voting members of the Academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all categories.
Winners for best documentary feature, best animated short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees.
Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most of his colleagues take the voting very seriously.
""I don't even vote (in a category) if I'm not familiar with the pictures in that category.
...
And I've never told someone to vote for a film, even when I've done some of them.""
Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken, speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman.
""Although you're asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank,"" he said.
Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.
""The Last Emperor"" took in $18.9 million, close to half the film's gross, after it won last year's best picture trophy.
More than 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986's best picture, ""Platoon,"" came after the film was nominated.
On average, a best picture award is worth about $20 million these days.
A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio, therefore, can be a good investment.
In the case of this year's awards, a flurry of Academy-oriented newspaper advertisements, banquets, complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late releases appears to have been remarkably successful.
This year, all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in December: ""The Accidental Tourist,"" ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" ""Rain Man"" and ""Working Girl"" were all released after Dec. 16.
While these five movies might be good, the nearly complete exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the studios' mastery of Oscar marketing.
""I think the Academy Awards are crap,"" said Terry Gilliam, director of ""Brazil"" and the current ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.""
""It's about selling films is all it's about,"" he said.
""It's one more way of flogging some films.
When `Brazil' got nominated (in 1986), they asked me to be a member of the Academy.
And I wouldn't join.
I just don't want to be a part of that at all.""
And at least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner, says that the manipulation of Oscar voters has reached new depths.
Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes for Sigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for ""Gorillas in the Mist,"" could lead him to vote against the film.
""I have in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaver and a beautiful gorilla than I need,"" Reiner said of promotional material sent to his home.
""We've got to tell the Academy to stop this advertising.
I'm getting turned off on the pictures I like.""","Oscar nominations and victories increase film earnings, with a Best Picture award worth about $20 million.

An Oscar nomination or victory has tremendous impact on a film's gross.
(Over 70 percent of the revenues for 1986's best picture came after the film was nominated.)
Amidst the flood of advertisements and enticements, some Academy members acknowledge committee voting.
Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc. said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots.","[[0, 42], [48, 142], [157, 188], [1198, 1211], [2888, 2981], [3193, 3262], [3275, 3308], [144, 165], [177, 188], [247, 324], [3513, 3541], [3552, 3566], [854, 1040]]"
"House passage of a plan to raise the minimum wage shifts the partisan battle to the Senate, where the leading proponent of an increase is urging President Bush to refrain from further veto threats while Congress settles on a final bill.
The House voted 248-171 Thursday in favor of legislation that would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this year.
The House then joined the Senate on an Easter recess that ends April 3.
High on the Senate agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would raise the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992.
Kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a statement issued after the House vote he asked Bush, who has threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above $4.25, to keep an open mind until the House and Senate agree on a bill.
""This is an excellent opportunity for Congress and the administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest training wage,"" Kennedy said.
Bush has insisted that a six-month sub-minimum training wage covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to raise the minimum wage, a provision he said will help offset potential job losses caused by raising the minimum.
Sponsors of the House bill, while disputing GOP projections of massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job.
That falls far short of the White House demand and, with Kennedy also opposed to Bush's training-wage proposal, that issue likely will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise.
Several Republicans insisted that Democrats were going to have to give in to Bush _ who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto _ or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage.
""The question is do you want a bill or do you want a political issue?""
Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said during an unsuccessful GOP effort to substitute Bush's proposal for the House leadership's measure.
""If you truly want to raise the minimum wage this is the only game in town.""
But Democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final increase from $4.65 an hour to $4.55 and by adding the new-hire wage.
As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85 an hour on Oct. 1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
The provision for the new-hire wage, to be pegged at 85 percent of the minimum wage, would expire Sept. 30, 1992.
It also would expand exemptions allowing small businesses to pay wages lower than the minimum wage and would allow employers of workers who earn tips to pay them 50 percent of the minimum wage, down from the current 60 percent.
Current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law; the House bill increased that level to $500,000.
The provision is rarely used, however, because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in conference committee if the Senate passes a minimum-wage bill.","The House passed a minimum wage bill that exceeded the amount which President Bush said he would veto.
The House asked the president to refrain from veto threats until after the Senate acts.
Senator Kennedy sponsored a bill that would raise the minimum to $4.65 by 1992 but is open to amending his bill and has asked the President to keep an open mind until the House and Senate agree.
The House bill would boost the wage to $4.55 by 1991 and would have a new hire wage pegged at 85% of the minimum.

"The calm waters of Prince William Sound have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in U.S. history, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid chunks of ice, officials said.
The spill of some 270,000 barrels _ or 11.3 million gallons _ occurred early Friday when the 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez went hard aground on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles outside Valdez, the northermost ice-free port in the United States.
Coast Guard spokesman Ed Wieliczkiewicz said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up the oil.
He said Exxon officials plan to pump the oil remaining aboard the Exxon Valdez onto the Exxon Baton Rouge, another tanker.
Early Friday the Exxon Valdez was losing 20,000 gallons of oil per hour, but the flow slowed to a trickle later.
An oil slick snaked about five miles from the ship as wind and tide pushed the crude oil into the sound and away from shore.
""This is the largest oil spill in U.S. history and it unfortunately took place in an enclosed water body with numerous islands, channels, bays and fiords,"" said Richard Golob, publisher of the Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin.
Gov. Steve Cowper said the ship was ""impaled on the reef.""
He said the vessel steered from its course to avoid chunks of ice and did not return to its normal traffic lane.
Dan Lawn, an engineer for the state Department of Environmental Conservation, said the captain could not steer the Exxon Valdez back on course in time to avoid a collision.
Lawn likened the ship's situation to ""trying to park a Cadillac in a Volkswagen spot.""
Divers were to check the ship's hull and their findings were to be used in making plans for the removal of crude oil still aboard the vessel.
""A spill of this size in such a complex environment promises to be a cleanup nightmare,"" said Golob, a Cambridge, Mass.-based consultant whose firm has studied oil spills and environmental disasters for 15 years.
In Washington, Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said efforts had begun to evacuate waterfowl, sea otters and other wildlife from the danger area.
The Exxon Valdez had loaded 1.2 million barrels of oil at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. marine terminal at Valdez and was en route to Long Beach, Calif., when it crunched onto the reef.
The ship marks the second aniversary of its maiden voyage today.
The terminal was closed early Friday to tanker traffic as officials tried to deal with the mammoth spill.
The flow in the trans-Alaska oil pipeline also was reduced to 800,000 barrels daily from 1.2 million barrels.
Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan said that, at the reduced rate, the marine terminal's capacity would allow nine days of operation before the line would have to be shut down.
Valdez, a town of about 3,000 year-round residents that grows to more than 4,000 with a summer influx of fishing industry workers and travelers, is a picturesque community about 125 miles east of Anchorage.
It relies on the fishing, oil and tourism industries.
The sound is considered a playground for kayakers, sport fishermen and tourists.
Jason Wells, executive director of the Valdez Fisheries Development Association, said he believed the oil slick would cause little damage unless wind pushes it back toward Valdez.
The fishing industry is between seasons.
Wells said the black cod fishery is scheduled to begin April 1, but the region's major herring fishery is not expected to get under way until mid-April.
But the spill likely will draw increasing fire from environmentalists sensitive about the trans-Alaska pipeline and efforts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development.
""It's of concern for two reasons: one is the size of the spill and that this is such a sensitive, very productive area,"" said Lisa Speer, senior staff scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.
Valdez City Manager Doug Griffin said the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline which carries oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez and the marine terminal have an enviable environmental record.
But he added: ""Living in Valdez, we've always worried that sometime something like this could happen.""
Previously, the largest U.S. tanker spill was the Dec. 15, 1976, grounding of the Argo Merchant tanker off the Nantucket shoals off Massachusetts, in which 7.6 million gallons of oil spilled, Golob said.
The largest tanker spill in history was in the July 19, 1979, collision off Tobago of the supertankers Atlantic Empress and Aegean Captain, in which 300,000 tons _ more than 80 million gallons _ of oil was lost.","Calm waters of Prince William Sound stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in US history.

The area relies on the oil, tourism, and fishing industries.
The black cod season begins April 1 and herring fishing begins mid-April.","[[19, 39], [73, 110], [240, 260], [263, 293], [310, 327], [333, 354], [3618, 3624], [2164, 2225], [2255, 2319], [2418, 2441], [2448, 2454], [2524, 2552], [2557, 2565], [2571, 2633], [3013, 3066], [3380, 3431], [3456, 3474], [3479, 3504], [3511, 3521]]"
"President Bush today renewed his threat to veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $4.25 an hour as Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage floor to $4.55.
House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who met with Bush and relayed his comments to reporters, said the president ""made it abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility, not one penny, not one deviation"" from his position on the minimum wage.
Bush met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the Senate opened debate on the legislation.
The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., would raise the hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by January 1992 and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers.
But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a ""sub-minimum"" for two months.
Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new employees a sub-minimum ""training wage"" for six months.
The GOP leaders who met with Bush said he also reiterated his opposition to shortening that time frame.
Another of the Republicans with whom Bush met, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., told reporters afterward that ""the message that was given to the president by the Senate (GOP) leadership was that we're going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue.
And we urged him not to back down from his commitment to $4.25 and the six-month training wage.""
Republicans could thwart the Democrats' quick-passage strategy by staging a filibuster, but an aide to one leading GOP senator said there were no plans to do that.
The aide said it appeared the Democrats had the votes to win passage of their plan by early next week.
Meanwhile, a new poll said there was overwhelming public support for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been at $3.35 since 1981.
The Washington Post@ABC News survey, conducted March 30 through April 3, said 84 percent of respondents backed an increase while 14 percent did not.
Eighty-two percent said they favored an increase even if it would trigger higher consumer prices.
But only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a higher minimum wage said they would hold to that opinion even if it meant businesses would stop hiring, or would fire, workers because of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage.
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
By agreeing to amend his bill, Kennedy, provided the amended version wins passage, averts the need for a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions.
A number of other amendments were also expected, including a GOP attempt to substitute Bush's proposal.
A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said Bush's repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by Democratic sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president.
""He says he won't compromise so I don't see a need for us to do anything except send him our bill,"" said AFL-CIO lobbyist Robert McGlotten.
Bush has been adamant in saying he would veto the House-passed bill and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto in both chambers of Congress.
While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly minimum wage to $4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three increases from Jan. 1 to Oct. 1 _
meaning the first increase would come this year and the last jump would occur Oct. 1, 1992.
Bush has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage beginning Jan. 1, 1990, and ending two years later with the hourly minimum at $4.25.
The president said his support for those increases hinges on a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for six months regardless of any past experience with another employer.
The sub-minimum, under the Bush plan, would be $3.35 an hour after the first increase in the minimum wage.
It would rise to $3.40 an hour by 1992.
The House-passed bill sets the wage for new hires _ provided it is their first job _ at $3.35 effective Oct. 1.
When the subsequent increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would rise as well, to 85 percent of the minimum.
The provision allowing the new-hire wage would expire on Sept. 30, 1992.","House Minority Leader Michel said that the President would show no flexibility on his position on the minimum wage.
Senator Kennedy, whose Senate bill calls for a higher wage than the House, said that he would offer an amendment to make his bill identical to that of the House.
A new poll showed strong backing for the increased wage even it triggered higher consumer prices, but fewer favored it if it meant loss of jobs.
Bush has proposed increases leading to a rate of $4.25 by 1992, if employers could hire new workers at a sub-minimum wage for six months.
The House bill would raise the wage to $4.55","[[188, 209], [214, 220], [287, 314], [326, 345], [357, 371], [407, 444], [581, 585], [596, 603], [764, 843], [551, 566], [2439, 2447], [2456, 2460], [2688, 2697], [1835, 1924], [2160, 2207], [2213, 2228], [2247, 2373], [3545, 3562], [3577, 3690], [3765, 3836], [3187, 3196], [3204, 3208], [3330, 3372]]"
"The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret to blow up.
None of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before the explosion instantly killed the seamen, Navy officials said.
They discarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hot debris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds.
The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium on firing 16-inch guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.
The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., while the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600 crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead.
At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announced President Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for the victims in Norfolk.
He said the president had heard of the service and told his staff ""if it could be fitted in, he wanted to be there ... wants to be a part.""
The blast occurred Wednesday morning northeast of Puerto Rico as the Iowa took part in firing exercises that were part of naval training.
A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captain both said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have been triggered by red-hot debris from earlier firings in the three-gun turret.
But Cmdr.
Mark Baker, chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office, said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired.
Only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of a training exercise had been fired, he said, and all had been from the No. 1 turret, forward of the one that exploded.
No eyewitnesses survived Wednesday's explosion behind one of the 16-inch guns on the Iowa, one of the largest warships ever.
Pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about the exact cause of the disaster, the worst to strike a Navy ship since 1977, but two officers _
Capt.
Paul Hanley, a fleet spokesman, and Capt.
Larry Seaquist, the ship's former captain _ said a possible explanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignited new charges.
But Seaquist stressed, ""We simply do not know what caused that powder to go.""
Baker said no guns in the No. 2 turret had been fired and the order had just been given to the No. 2 turret crew to load and prepare the center gun when the explosion occurred.
""We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired,"" Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he headed back to Washington from a NATO meeting in Brussels.
The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico to unload the bodies, which were then flown to Delaware.
Navy investigators boarded the ship as it left for Norfolk, where it is expected to arrive Sunday or Monday.
Navy Secretary William Ball attended a memorial service at the Delaware base, home of the armed services' largest mortuary.
The flag-draped coffins were carried off a plane by Navy honor guards.
Around the United States, Navy officers and chaplains broke the bad news to the dead men's next of kin.
The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when officials in Norfolk received the list of the dead.
""I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it,"" said Cmdr.
Doug Palmer, acting chaplain for the Norfolk Navy Base.
Five men had families in the Norfolk area.
The commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, Adm. Jerome Johnson, who was on board the Iowa, told reporters in Puerto Rico, ""The fire and explosion was instantaneous.""
Cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gun house at the top of the turret, rather than the mechanical compartments and ammunition magazines below it.
Eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship at the base of the turret.
A dozen crew members suffered minor injuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion.
They were treated and returned to duty, said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman.
At the White House, President Bush brushed aside suggestions that the explosion was due to the age of the Iowa, a World War II leviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup of the Reagan administration.
Asked about the ship's safety, Bush said he wanted to insure that procedures were checked ""to be sure that safety is at the highest point ...
but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way that makes a useful platform obsolete.""
Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey, began the board of inquiry's investigation.
Hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would be completed.
Seaquist told reporters, ""It seems from the reports that those powders exploded.""
He referred to the six 110-pound sacks of powder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound shell.
Seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from the breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually.
Each gun has a one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3,000 pounds of pressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel.
The only officer killed was Lt.
j.g.
Phillip Edward Buch from Las Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment at the rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the room in which shells are loaded.
Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that ""cooks off"" _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.
""The first thing that comes to mind is something like a cook-off,"" said Hanley.
""It could have been a bag or a projectile.
We just don't know yet.""
None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which saw service in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, has ever sustained such an explosion, Pentagon officials said.
Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for the Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was struck by a Spanish freighter.
Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the current Navy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class are the largest warships in the world.","Naval investigators boarded the battleship Iowa to find out the cause of Wednesday's gun explosion during a training exercise.

""They all were, in the words of a poet, `the men behind the guns.'""
""They came from Hidalgo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa, Florida; Costa Mesa, California.
They came to the Navy as strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends, and left the Navy as brothers in eternity.
In the finest Navy tradition, they served proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa.""
The president, a World War II Navy pilot, said he was proud to recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle stars in two wars.
But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, ""Fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.""
The Iowa's commander, Capt.
Fred P. Moosally, said the turret's crew was the best gun crew on the ship, and called its chief _
Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson, N.Y. _
""my No. 1 chief.""
Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for the service.
A bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium; behind were an American flag and the battleship's banners.
Outside, another 2,000 people listened to the service on loudspeakers.
As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush.
Many were angry they could not attend, said Machinist's Mate David Finn, 38.
""It was very important to them,"" Finn said.
The service came a day after the World War II-era battleship eased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500 crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory of their dead shipmates.
Moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men of turret No. 2.
""I remember their faces as they toiled at their guns, sweating an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great cause,"" he said.
""I remember as they talked among themselves, looking so much like sailors of the past, sharing the exuberance of the times and the dreams of the future,"" he said.
""They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship. ...
They made the ultimate sacrifice for us. ...
The men of Turret Two will be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever.""
Bush recounted seeing the Iowa off the coast of the Philippines as a naval aviator in World War II, and the great sense of confidence the big ship lent to the fleet.
Addressing the children of the victims, he said: ""You must never forget that your father was America's pride.""
At the end of the service, while the Navy Hymn was played, President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men.
After the 45-minute service, the families attended a private reception with Moosally.
The Navy said 45 victims' families attended the service.
At a press briefing following the reception, Moosally praised the hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage.
""God gave birth to 500 heroes,"" the captain said.
""Fire on a ship is the most terrifying fear ...
you have nowhere to run.""
""Our extensive training paid off,"" he said.
""Besides the firefighting crews, we had cooks, engineers, deck seamen, Marines all fighting to save the ship.""
Moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to Vice Adm. Jerome Johnson, commander of the 2nd Fleet, to tell him to watch the No. 2 turret because it contained his best crew.
""This was my best turret,"" Moosally said.
He said turret chief Ziegler ""was the most meticulous of men.
He was my No. 1 chief of the 84 chiefs aboard.""
""Nobody in that turret did anything unless they were qualified,"" Moosally said.
Moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters' questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired, saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary.
All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it.
At the time, the Iowa was conducting open seas gun exercises off Puerto Rico.
The Navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing.
Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion.
Cmdr.
John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.
""I'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off,"" the captain said.
One of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt, 21, of Tampa, Fla., said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything was wrong.
""We were waiting for the gun to fire, and we weren't sure,"" he said.
When the men discovered that no one was answering the interior turret communications link, Truitt ordered the powder returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.
The sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck, Truitt recalled.
""My first thought was that I'd better get to a lifeboat station, because if the fire got to the magazine things would be bad,"" he said.","At a memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station Monday for the 47 Battleship Iowa crewmen who perished in an explosion, President Bush spoke to 6000 mourners crowded into a hangar.

He was my No. 1 chief of the 84 chiefs aboard.""
""Nobody in that turret did anything unless they were qualified,"" Moosally said.
Moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters' questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired, saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary.
All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it.
At the time, the Iowa was conducting open seas gun exercises off Puerto Rico.
The Navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing.
Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion.
Cmdr.
John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.
""I'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off,"" the captain said.
One of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt, 21, of Tampa, Fla., said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything was wrong.
""We were waiting for the gun to fire, and we weren't sure,"" he said.
When the men discovered that no one was answering the interior turret communications link, Truitt ordered the powder returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.
The sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck, Truitt recalled.
""My first thought was that I'd better get to a lifeboat station, because if the fire got to the magazine things would be bad,"" he said.","Relatives of the 47 victims killed in the No.2 gun explosion aboard the Iowa last Wednesday were among the 6000 people who attended a memorial at Norfolk Naval Air Station on Monday.
President Bush, a WWII Navy pilot, and the ship's commander, Capt.
Fred P. Moosally, led the service.
Moosally praised the No. 2 gun turret crew as the best on the ship.
At the end of the service, President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men.
As many as 500 Iowa crewmen, delayed by traffic, were unable to attend because of presidential security measures.","[[34, 60], [115, 121], [310, 362], [1271, 1278], [1342, 1369], [229, 248], [879, 887], [915, 976], [1040, 1042], [1061, 1071], [132, 146], [745, 770], [806, 809], [1054, 1058], [1072, 1087], [1089, 1105], [1180, 1185], [1392, 1407], [1097, 1142], [2184, 2203], [2253, 2257], [2966, 2991], [3025, 3099], [1597, 1646], [1667, 1727], [1739, 1783]]"

""She was a whole package.
There never will be another one like her.
I love her,"" said a tearful Carol Burnett following a memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica.

The 77-year-old comedian who starred in one of television's biggest all-time hits, ""I Love Lucy,"" died here April 26 of a ruptured aorta, a major blood vessel, eight days after emergency open-heart surgery.
Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed expressions and wacky antics, was popular among generations of fans who watched ""I Love Lucy"" as a first-run show in the '50s and in three decades of reruns.
""She showed her love in the only way she knew how, by making you laugh,"" the Rev. James Fox told those gathered for the Roman Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola in New York.
Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over whether there is laughter in heaven.
""A God who would have created her would never let her laughter be far from Him,"" said Ms. Sawyer.
In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball ""to show us life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending.""
""She taught us that if we could love Lucy, we could love ourselves,"" Wall said.
In announcing the services, Miss Ball's family said: ""Monday night was the time when most of the nation was used to being with Lucy.""
Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball starred, ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy,"" aired Monday nights.
""I Love Lucy"" had starting times on Mondays and other days.
""Lucille Ball gave the gift of humor which produced happiness,"" said Schuller at the Santa Monica service.

Fans lined up to get in the Santa Monica church as much as four hours early.
Florists delivered arrangements including a 3-foot heart of red carnations with the words ""I Love Lucy"" written across.
Hundreds of people came forward during Holy Communion to receive blessings from three priests, including a woman wearing an ""I Love Lucy"" T-shirt.
""I think she would have loved it very much, and she lived her life for the people who were in that room tonight,"" said Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Miss Ball and the late Desi Arnaz.

"Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy banners and the tents of China's freedom movement, replaced by tanks, armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers.
The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the capital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement for political change.
Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for city residents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeks stood at the heart of the movement.
Buses and bicyclists today were allowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge of the square.
The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, was taken by a tread-wheeled armored personnel carrier.
When students built the statue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movement for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption.
On Sunday morning, a tank crushed it.
In all, 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers lined the northern part of the square.
The Monument to Revolutionary Martyrs, where the students took a final stand early Sunday, was swept clean.
Poems and posters calling for a more open China have disappeared from its sides.
Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and 60,000 injured over the weekend, citing a Chinese students' organization, the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany.
The government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed; diplomats and Chinese say up to 3,000 died.
Soldiers drilled in Tiananmen's center, their cadenced shouting echoing around the vast expanse.
A crowd of officials stood on the roof of the Great Hall of the People, overlooking the square.
From this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant mass of demonstrators enveloped 5,000 troops and blocked their entry to the square.
Inside the square, soldiers could be seen shuffling about, their uniformed jackets stripped off, wash basins in hand.
There was a relaxed air of the inside of an army barracks as unarmed troops carried food and walked slowly together, talking and laughing in groups.
The area once housing students' tents has become a holding area for a huge fleet of troop trucks.
On the southern perimeter, a single line of tanks and a cordon of soldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists who pedaled slowly by, peering into Tiananmen.
Near the square, troops placed barbed wire in front of one street.
Soldiers were billeted in a construction site, their laundered fatigues drying on the scaffolding.
Next door, troops, their assault rifles slung nonchalantly over their shoulders, stood and chatted outside a discotheque.

So far this fire season, the agency has had 31,000 fires reported, which have burned 1,117,000 acres.
In the same period last year, it had 54,000 fires but 765,000 acres burned.
The fact that there are more acres burned this year, but fewer fires, ""means this year's fires are in very rugged, inaccessible terrain, which makes them hard to fight,"" said Hartigan.
""Also, some of them are in areas where there have not been any fires for years, and that means there is excellent fuel available.""
The largest fire in the Lower 48 states was the week-old Diamond Peak fire in Utah, which had burned 12,200 acres of forest and brush in an area 20 miles west of the Utah-Colorado border, just north of Interstate 70.
It was 80 percent contained, but after a week of temperatures around 100 degrees, the National Weather Service predicted possible dry lightning storms and gusting wind.
Elsewhere in Utah, the Uinta Canyon fire had burned 3,850 acres 20 miles north of Roosevelt in the Ashley National Forest.
Forest Service spokeswoman Cece Stewart said three helicopters scattered incendiary bombs made of chemically treated plastic balls on an unburned 200-acre area between fire lines and the main fire in an effort to stop the fire's advance.
High wind also was expected in northern California, where a 2,500-acre fire near Janesville on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada destroyed two mobile homes.
U.S. 395 between Milford and Janesville was closed.
""The wind was pretty brisk.
It just blew the fire and pushed it out,"" said Forest Service spokesman Dave Reider.
Relentless winds first pushed the fire north, then south, prompting Sheriff Ron Jarrel to order the evacuation of a sparsely populated area about a mile south of the fire line, Reider said.
It was unknown how many people were affected.
Spokesman Larry Lathrop said a helicopter battling the fire crashed Saturday about four miles southeast of Janesville.
Lathrop said the pilot walked away from the crash, but the helicopter was destroyed.
The chopper apparently was making a water drop when it crashed.
In the Sierra foothills near Oroville, north of Sacramento, a 750-acre fire was contained Saturday after burning four homes, six outbuildings and six vehicles, and forcing about 150 residents to flee briefly Friday night, according to the California Department of Forestry.
Firefighters gained the upper hand on a trio of forest fires in Colorado's drought-stricken mountains Saturday, but a new blaze of an estimated 3,000 acres in grass and timber on the eastern plains had crews scrambling to protect a subdivision in Elbert County.
Residents of nine homes in the subdivision about 25 miles northeast of Kiowa were evacuated Friday night, but later were allowed to return home.
In the Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming, a fire had grown to 3,420 acres, burning an additional 1,000 acres in 24 hours, according to forest officials.
Forest spokesman Ed Christian said the fire was about 50 percent contained by Saturday night and that with some cooperation from the weather, crews should be able to complete their containment line by Monday.
Officials in Arizona gave priority to the Marijilda fire, which had blackened 2,500 acres of forest on the north side of Mount Graham near Safford, and the Chiva fire east of Tucson, which had burned 8,300 acres in the Rincon Mountains, according to BLM spokesman Wendell Peacock.
Arizona's largest fire until Saturday, in the Peloncillo Mountains south of Duncan, along the Arizona-New Mexico border, had charred 8,000 acres but was 80 percent contained.

The fact that there are more acres burned this year, but fewer fires, ""means this year's fires are in very rugged, inaccessible terrain, which makes them hard to fight,"" said Hartigan.
""Also, some of them are in areas where there have not been any fires for years, and that means there is excellent fuel available.""
The largest fire in the Lower 48 states was the week-old Diamond Peak fire in Utah, which had burned 12,200 acres of forest and brush in an area 20 miles west of the Utah-Colorado border, just north of Interstate 70.
It was 80 percent contained, but after a week of temperatures around 100 degrees, the National Weather Service predicted possible dry lightning storms and gusting wind.
Elsewhere in Utah, the Uinta Canyon fire had burned 3,850 acres 20 miles north of Roosevelt in the Ashley National Forest.
Forest Service spokeswoman Cece Stewart said three helicopters scattered incendiary bombs made of chemically treated plastic balls on an unburned 200-acre area between fire lines and the main fire in an effort to stop the fire's advance.
High wind also was expected in northern California, where a 2,500-acre fire near Janesville on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada destroyed two mobile homes.
U.S. 395 between Milford and Janesville was closed.
""The wind was pretty brisk.
It just blew the fire and pushed it out,"" said Forest Service spokesman Dave Reider.
Relentless winds first pushed the fire north, then south, prompting Sheriff Ron Jarrel to order the evacuation of a sparsely populated area about a mile south of the fire line, Reider said.
It was unknown how many people were affected.
Spokesman Larry Lathrop said a helicopter battling the fire crashed Saturday about four miles southeast of Janesville.
Lathrop said the pilot walked away from the crash, but the helicopter was destroyed.
The chopper apparently was making a water drop when it crashed.
In the Sierra foothills near Oroville, north of Sacramento, a 750-acre fire was contained Saturday after burning four homes, six outbuildings and six vehicles, and forcing about 150 residents to flee briefly Friday night, according to the California Department of Forestry.
Firefighters gained the upper hand on a trio of forest fires in Colorado's drought-stricken mountains Saturday, but a new blaze of an estimated 3,000 acres in grass and timber on the eastern plains had crews scrambling to protect a subdivision in Elbert County.
Residents of nine homes in the subdivision about 25 miles northeast of Kiowa were evacuated Friday night, but later were allowed to return home.
In the Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming, a fire had grown to 3,420 acres, burning an additional 1,000 acres in 24 hours, according to forest officials.
Forest spokesman Ed Christian said the fire was about 50 percent contained by Saturday night and that with some cooperation from the weather, crews should be able to complete their containment line by Monday.
Officials in Arizona gave priority to the Marijilda fire, which had blackened 2,500 acres of forest on the north side of Mount Graham near Safford, and the Chiva fire east of Tucson, which had burned 8,300 acres in the Rincon Mountains, according to BLM spokesman Wendell Peacock.
Arizona's largest fire until Saturday, in the Peloncillo Mountains south of Duncan, along the Arizona-New Mexico border, had charred 8,000 acres but was 80 percent contained.
Firefighters spent an eighth day Saturday battling the lightning-caused, 8,139-acre Divide fire 50 miles northeast of Silver City in the Gila National Forest in southwestern New Mexico, U.S. Forest Service officials said.
Firefighters in north-central Washington encircled a 4,500-acre range fire early Saturday.","Thousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke Saturday in seven states in the West, threatening homes in some places.
Fire crews were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, California and Washington.
Elsewhere, four big fires burned in interior Alaska, one having charred an estimated 24,000 acres.
A fire in Georgia's Okefenoke swamp that burned 500 acres of habitat for an endangered species of woodpecker was reported under control.
The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on the fire lines.

""We hope Mother Nature cooperates with us,"" said Mary Plumb of the federal Bureau of Land Management in Utah.
Record highs included 97 at Cheyenne, Wyo., and 100 at Denver, while Casper, Wyo., tied its record of 100.
That was Denver's fifth consecutive day at 100 degrees or higher.

"President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation European tour, met with West German President Richard von Weizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other officials.
Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her homeland.
""We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor,"" she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade.
""We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars,"" she said.
Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ""was in fact stolen by the previous government"" of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
She said that since her government took over in 1986, the country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.
""What we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the German recovery _ debt relief and investments,"" Mrs. Aquino said.
During a state banquet in the evening, Weizsaecker told Mrs. Aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between West Germany and the Philippines.
Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in trade with West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market the European Economic Community plans for 1992 will not lock out trade with other countries.

"Gen. Colin Powell, tapped as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is widely viewed as an adroit politician and pragmatic commander capable of representing the U.S. military at a time of sweeping change both home and abroad.
Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to become the nation's top military officer.
""I am ready to go to it and I look forward to the challenges ahead,"" Powell said.
He's expected to win easy Senate confirmation and make history as the first black and the youngest-ever officer to hold the post.
Powell, who served as national security adviser in the final year of President Ronald Reagan's administration, will succeed Adm. William Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.
Bush praised Powell, a decorated veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam, as ""a complete soldier"" as well as a distinguished scholar.
""As we face the challenges of the '90s, it is most important that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be a person of breadth, judgment, experience and total integrity,"" Bush said.
""Colin Powell has all those qualities and more.""
Powell fits the mold of Bush's national security advisers, like-minded pragmatists who favor consensus-building rather than confrontation.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, called Powell ""an excellent nominee.""
Nunn said his panel will hold confirmation proceedings soon after Congress returns from recess in September.
The four-star general's associates predicted he will work hard to present all sides to the commander-in-chief.
""He was marvelous to work with, because he could deal with all the internal conflicts"" that the National Security Council adviser must resolve for the president, said Dan Howard, former NSC spokesman who was recently confirmed as undersecretary of the Navy.
""Colin was an honest broker. ...
He was very fair in presenting others' viewpoints.
That doesn't mean he didn't have one, because he did.
He was just very fair, and could present all sides without putting a `spin' on it.
That's a rare talent in this town,"" Howard said.
Such abilities will be essential when Powell is called upon to deal with the intense rivalries that can afflict the Pentagon.
Contests among the services are widely expected to reach new highs as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the Soviet threat diminishes.
As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political finesse with Congress are as essential as toughened battlefield instincts.
Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have outweighed his military experience.
But those who know him contend his mix of jobs, in command roles and political trenches of Washington, will stand him in good stead.
""He's been head of the NSC.
He's commanded troops in Europe.
He's dealt with the (National) Guard and reserve in his current post and he's been at the elbow of the secretary of defense.
He's had experiences few can match,"" said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide.
Powell currently is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1 million troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty.
Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House recover from the Iran-Contra affair.
He was a key figure in the planning of Reagan's national security strategy and for his summits with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Before his stint at the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps in West Germany for six months.
Earlier, he was Weinberger's senior military assistant from 1983-86.
Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City and raised in the South Bronx.
He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a bachelor's degree in geology at the City University of New York.
He got his first taste of the White House in 1972 during a stint as a White House fellow at the Office of Management and Budget.
Powell served in Southeast Asia as an adviser to South Vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and 1969.
Holder of a Purple Heart for being wounded in combat, Powell also won the Bronze Star for valor.","General Colin Powell was nominated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Thursday by President Bush.

"A Florida couple said their pleasure boat was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard reported Sunday.
William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were ""weak but recovering"" at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo.
The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by telephone early Sunday.
The U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command is headquartered in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco.
William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by ""several"" whales on June 15 about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
""They were large, according to Mr. Butler,"" Vallecillo said.
""But he didn't know how many whales.""
The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said.
Vallecillo said he'd heard of boats running into marine mammals when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any recorded cases of whale aggression.
""This happened in the early morning hours"" with good visibility, he said.
""This is the first (case) I've documented.""
As the boat was sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing rods and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat, where they remained for the next two months, Vallecillo said.
As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit.
Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its ""fisheries"" patrol about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued the couple.
They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said.
Butler is an experienced sailor, he said.

"Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable property, a tax office near the Imperial Palace announced Monday.
It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi Tax Office said.
Until the end of World War II, emperors were regarded as living gods.
Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87.
He was succeeded by Akihito, his eldest son.
Hirohito's wife, Nagako, became empress dowager.

"Bob Hope keeps voluminous files, including the jokes he delivered and people he has performed with, and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called ""G.I. Journal.""
""I really can't remember many details about it,"" said Hope, who pays tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday night.
It's called ""Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball.""
She died in April of this year.
That first time together was followed by four movies, frequent visits by Hope on ""I Love Lucy"" and regular appearances by Lucy on his television shows.
""Lucy was a very funny woman,"" Hope said.
""Even in private she could get off a great ad lib.
But it's hard to compare her with other funny women.
It's like asking who's the best golfer.
You have to go to the records.
I don't think anyone ever had the success she had.
She certainly holds the most records.""
A secretary dug the details of that first joint appearance out of one of two vaults where Hope keeps everything pertaining to his long comic career.
There are written records of all his shows, copies of all the scripts, monologues and comic routines, audio tapes of his radio shows and thousands of other mementos.
""G.I. Journal"" was on May 4, 1945.
Hope's file reads: ""Spot: Lucille Ball ...
English play ...
For Charity Bazaar.""
Hope and Ball had actually known each other before they began working together.
In fact, the late Desi Arnaz, her then husband, worked for Hope first.
He said Ball asked him nearly 50 years ago to find a place on his popular radio show for band leader Arnaz.
""Stan Kenton was leaving as my orchestra leader,"" Hope said.
""I gave Desi a spot on my show.
We also gave him some lines to speak.
Every time he walked up to the microphone he dropped an enchilada.
He could hardly talk, let alone get a laugh.
When they started `I Love Lucy,' I said, `What's going on?
This man is funny.""'
""The night before she died I performed at the Music Center,"" he said.
""Lucy was in the hospital and I saw her daughter, Lucie Arnaz, and said, `Isn't it wonderful she's doing better.'
They called me the next day and said she had died.
I said, `God has her now, but we'll have her forever.'
We'll be watching her performances for a long, long time.""
""Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucy"" will include clips from their movies and TV appearances, plus such guest stars as Betty White, George Burns and Danny Thomas.
""I'm going through everything myself picking out the clips,"" Hope said.
""The last time she was on my show was my birthday show two years ago.
We sang `I Remember It Well.'
Our last time together in public was at the Academy Awards in March.
I think I'll do my tribute to her over a shot of that in the background.
I think everyone remembers that.""
She was on his radio show on May 27, 1947, at Detroit.
The program notes say, ""Lucille Ball: New York, clothes, cars, pictures.""
""I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage,"" Hope said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the special.
""She had great gowns and hairdos.
When she performed she would use different styles.
She'd change the way she read a line.
She'd throw a line away one time, then she'd turn around and milk a line for laughs.""
Hope recalled his funny co-star in a sunny alcove in the living room of his Los Angeles home.
It overlooks the one-hole golf course in the back yard, and he was attired in golfing clothes.
Occasionally, he called his office in another building on the grounds to check on a piece of information.
Soon after the interview, he was aboard a plane for a series of personal appearances around the country.
Ball made 22 appearances on Hope's specials and he was on her shows 10 or 12 times, he said.
In their first movie, ""Sorrowful Jones"" in 1949, Hope played a racetrack bookie who's forced to become the foster father of a young girl whose real father was killed by gangsters in a racehorse fix.
Ball was a nightclub singer who helps him look after the girl.
It was a remake of ""Little Miss Marker,"" which starred Shirley Temple in 1934.
Next was ""Fancy Pants"" in 1950, a remake of ""Ruggles of Red Gap.""
Ball played a rich rancher who acquires an English butler, played by Hope.
""Facts of Life"" was in 1960, with Hope and Ball as married lovers who have a tryst.
Their last film was ""Critic's Choice"" in 1963, in which Hope is a Broadway critic who has to review a play written by his wife, played by Ball.
""Someone reminded me the other night of a bus tour we did of movie theaters in New York to promote one our of pictures,"" he said.

British military installations are a frequent bombing target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule, but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 miles southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland in more than seven years.
The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks.
One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
Dozens of homes near the school were damaged, including four that were destroyed.
Witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles away.
The Defense Ministry would not say how many servicemen and civilians were included in the casualty figures.
However, King told reporters the attack was directed against ""unarmed bandsmen.""
Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search through the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons.
Ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and 11 ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service said.
A statement telephoned to Ireland International, a Dublin news agency, said ""we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent"" in response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Northern Ireland nine days ago.
The IRA said Mrs. Thatcher went to the British province ""with a message of war,"" but ""we still want peace and we want the British government to leave our country.""
It was signed P. O'Neill, a nom de guerre the IRA usually uses to claim responsibility for actions outside Northern Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey issued a statement in Dublin condemning the attack, calling it an ""outrage.""
The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in February when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded.
One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA bomb attack on an army barracks in north London in August 1988.
In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks in central London and at a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing.
Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings.
The music school is the training center for young recruits who want to play in the seven Royal Marines bands.
Up to 250 young men, most between 16 and 20, are based at the school, where they receive military and musical training.
The roof of Janet Minnock's house was torn off by the force of the blast and all the back windows were shattered.
""The house has been blown to bits,"" she said.
""We are all shaken up.""
Mrs. Minnock's next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, said she was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of the explosion.
She was holding her 4-month-old son Luke in her arms with her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, at her side.
""I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,"" she said.
""I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a slither of glass embedded itself in his back.
The whole window was blown across the kitchen.
I just screamed and ran out of the room.
The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in.""
Sean Minnock said: ""I was asleep but woke up with a hell of a jolt.""
As workers tried to patch holes in his roof, he said: ""The bedroom ceiling fell in on me.
I woke to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor.
I wondered what it was.
As soon as I got up I looked out of what was left of the window and knew it was the barracks.""","An explosion at 8:28 A.M. today destroyed a military barracks near Deal.
Police said that 11 were killed and 22 injured.
The British Defense Ministry would not confirm the casualty figures.
The barracks housed the Royal Marines School of Music.
Dozens of home were damaged, some severely.
The IRA issued a statement saying what happened to the Royal Marines was an answer to Margaret Thatcher's ""message of war"".

"An explosion today flattened a military barracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people and injuring 22, police said.
The IRA claimed responsibility for the blast.
More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal.
Stunned neighbors gathered outside homes that were damaged or destroyed.
Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent, who who provided the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort, first reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was accounted for.

"Prince Philip on Sunday condemned the ""senseless"" killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRA bombing, and Britain's defense secretary said he warned all military bases of the risk of similar attacks.
Clergyman urged relatives and friends of dead and maimed musicians to forgive the bombers.
""Only forgiveness breaks the tie between the hater and the hated,"" the Rev. George Lings told mourners.
The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and captain general of the Royal Marines, visited injured men in the hospital and toured the severely damaged Royal Marines School of Music in Deal, southeast Britain.
""It will not help the IRA win anything,"" said Philip, who wore a Royal Marines tie.
""It is senseless.

Mountbatten was India's last viceroy and a cousin of the queen.
British military installations are a frequent target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.

King defended the use of private security firms hired to guard the Deal school and 29 other ""low-risk"" military installations in Britain.
Local residents and grieving relatives have said security was lax and should be turned back to the marines.
King said the private firms will remain.
""It is important to remember that what we need in these cases are eyes and ears and observation,"" King said on British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
""Private security guards can be a very useful additional assistance.
They also help to reduce the amount of time soldiers have to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of their activity.""
At church services throughout the small port, clergymen urged mourners to pray for and forgive the bombers.
The Rev. Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the 300-member congregation inside the barracks, ""if you can find room in your hearts ... pray for the men who perpetrated this terrible act, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from their violent and evil ways.""

It was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland since July 1982.

"Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.

"Two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds.
Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late father, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years before his death in 1976.
The younger Daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his spring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the primary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21 Cabinet positions.
But now Daley finds himself on the defensive.
Some black politicians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not doing enough to stop it.
The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a City Council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks.
""There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism,"" said Bob Starks, associate professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois University.
""It's the same stuff, and it's seemingly getting worse.""
But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is ""irresponsible political rhetoric"" from black politicians who are looking ahead to the 1991 mayoral election.
Daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in November 1987.
Daley has denounced the alleged police brutality.
""I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago,"" Daley said.
""Everyone should join together ... to help alleviate this problem.""
Also last week, a human relations task force made up of business and civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago was fueled by ""a shocking lack of contact"" between the city's ethnic groups.
The report, based on a 15-month investigation of the city's race relations, concluded that racial divisions ""threaten to make Chicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are antithetical to the city's economic growth and prosperity.""
At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _
most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
Among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, Callie Bryant, who testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her ""the sign of the Ku Klux Klan.""

"Two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds.
Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late father, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years before his death in 1976.
The younger Daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his spring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the primary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21 Cabinet positions.
But now Daley finds himself on the defensive.
Some black politicians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not doing enough to stop it.
The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a City Council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks.
""There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism,"" said Bob Starks, associate professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois University.
""It's the same stuff, and it's seemingly getting worse.""
But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is ""irresponsible political rhetoric"" from black politicians who are looking ahead to the 1991 mayoral election.
Daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in November 1987.
Daley has denounced the alleged police brutality.
""I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago,"" Daley said.
""Everyone should join together ... to help alleviate this problem.""
Also last week, a human relations task force made up of business and civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago was fueled by ""a shocking lack of contact"" between the city's ethnic groups.
The report, based on a 15-month investigation of the city's race relations, concluded that racial divisions ""threaten to make Chicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are antithetical to the city's economic growth and prosperity.""

"Plans announced by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian to build a 5,000-room resort here would allow Las Vegas to claim the eight largest hotels in the world by 1992, according to industry statistics.
Of course, Las Vegas' domination of the list dpends on other cities not building big hotels between now and 1992.
The Las Vegas Hilton currently claims the title with 3,174 rooms but will be surpassed next March when an expansion is completed at the Flamingo Hilton, giving that Strip resort 3,530 rooms.
The Flamingo will hold the title only a few months, until the Excalibur opens next summer with 4,032 rooms.
Steve Wynn's Mirage Hotel opens next month with 3,054 rooms.
Circus Circus, the parent corporation for Excalibur, currently has 2,800 rooms in Las Vegas, as does Bally's Hotel on the Strip.
The Riviera Hotel currently has 2,200 rooms but a planned expansion will give the resort 3,800 rooms by June of 1992.
Kerkorian built the International Hotel, now the Las Vegas Hilton, and the MGM Grand, now Bally's.
He also owned the Flamingo at one time.
The Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu currently has 2,525 rooms, making it the largest hotel, in number of rooms, outside of Las Vegas, according to figures in the Hotel and Motel Index.
The number of rooms at the Hawaiian property is not expected to change in the near future because the hotel recently completed an expansion, according to Las Vegas Hilton spokesman Bruce Banke.

"Terry Anderson spent a fifth birthday as a hostage today, a grim milestone in his captivity.
His relatives and friends marked the event with a flood of messages and with a Mass in Washington.
Radio reports said Lebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday message from his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome.
The daily newspapers An-Nahar and As-Safir and the French-language L'Orient-Le Jour published English texts of letters to Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press who was abducted March 16, 1985.
His sister, Peggy Say, wrote, ""In honor of your birthday on Friday, we will be in Washington with other hostage families to mark another sad year in which you have been denied your freedom.""
The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, made up of colleagues from all over the United States, wrote: ""Please believe that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray for you.""
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a 33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists and former colleagues in Tokyo.
Anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment in Japan 1979-1981.
Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the State Department and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria, attended a Mass in Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel, where Mrs. Say said such ceremonies ensure her brother will not be forgotten.
Gunmen seized the 42-year-old Anderson in Moslem west Beirut after a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from his reporting on Lebanon's civil war.
He has not held Sulome, born three months after the morning he was kidnapped.
He probably does not know that his father and brother died of cancer.
Anderson's fate now appears to be caught up in a power struggle between Shiite Moslem radicals and moderates.
He was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad, a group loyal to Iran whose name means Islamic Holy War.
His abductors demand the release of 15 men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983.
Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American who was acting dean of agriculture at American University of Beirut.
Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon.
Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year, reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their comrades jailed in Kuwait.
A copy of the statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut was accompanied by a photograph of Anderson similar to one released Nov. 4, 1988, after his last birthday.
The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use its influence to free the hostages if the United States released Iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since 1979.
Kuwait has refused to free the prsoners, but two members of the group were released in February after completing five-year sentences.
The United States has said it will not negotiate with terrorists.
Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, most believed held by pro-Iranians.
Islamic Jihad issued its statement as the leader of Iran's revolutionary radicals, former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to Lebanon.
He met with prominent Shiites, including leading figures in Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella group for kidnap gangs.
It was not clear why Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main political rival, came to Lebanon.
But the trip underlined his power struggle with Rafsanjani, leader of the comparatively moderate ""pragmatists"" who want to restore relations with the West.
A knowledgeable Shiite said privately the Islamic Jihad statement was ""a clear indication that the hostage-holders are not under Rafsanjani's control.""
Hezbollah appears to have split into factions, with the main groups supporting either Rafsanjani or Mohtashemi.
Rafsanjani dismissed Mohtashemi after his election as president July 28.
The former interior minister's surprise appearance in Lebanon quashed reports from Tehran that he was under house arrest.
Mohtashemi returned to Tehran on Wednesday via Damascus, Syria.
Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a few letters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaper and television reports about relatives.
American and French hostages who shared his captivity and were released have told of his courage and fears, how he has defied his captors and suffered the agonies of captivity.
His father, Glenn, and elder brother, Glenn Jr., died of cancer in 1986.
Released hostages said he did not know of the deaths.
Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, but has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him to watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released by the kidnappers.","Terry Anderson marked the fifth year as a hostage today.

"Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments, the Soviet news media reported Friday.
The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of improved living and job conditions.
Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament that would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgrade benefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.
The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving a sympathetic view of the workers condition's in the Arctic Cirle coal-mining districts, said many miners do not see daylight for months because of their underground work and the sun dips below the horizon in the winter.
A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the latest round of strikes is illegal but did not impose any penalties.
The miners's unions said the decision will be appealed.
Coal miners in the northern region and the Ukraine struck for two weeks this summer but returned to work in July after parliament passed a resolution promising reforms, including improved social and economic conditions.
The miners say the government has renedged on its promises.
The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes: Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largest mine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighth day, according to Tass.
Komsomolskaya Pravda said night-shift workers walked out at three mines in Vorkuta and at another one the miners were still working but were preventing the coal from being shipped outside the region.
In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's major coal-producing area, miner representatives were discussing another strike.
Tens of thousands of miners walked off the job for two hours Wednesday.

""It was fast,"" said Lucy Lee Rusk, whose apartment was battered by debris.
""It was like one big pop and that's when everything went.""
The National Weather Service had issued a tornado watch earlier in the day, but did not issue a more urgent tornado warning until 4:39 p.m. CST, when the tornado was spotted at the municipal golf course.
By then, it was already tearing up the city.
A watch means a tornado is considered possible, while a warning means a tornado is believed to exist.
Huntsville Police Maj.
Robert Moder said this morning that 463 people were injured by the twister, which plowed through a school and rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.
Police Chief Richard Ottman initially put the number of dead at 19, but his clerk, Kitty Whitworth, later said the death toll was lowered to 17 after police confirmed the count of bodies.
She said police had no firm reports of people missing.
No children in the school were killed, but about 30 youngsters were in a kindergarten class at the building, and five were reported injured.
Most of the dead were in apartments, stores or cars.
Mayor Steve Hettinger estimated the number of homeless at 1,000 and said officials were preparing a request for federal disaster assistance.
A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said 42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood of the survivors as ""shock, mostly, and disbelief.""
""They're thankful to be alive and they're thankful their families are alive,"" he said, adding that the shelter had received calls from around the country from worried relatives.
The tornado was Alabama's deadliest since a 1975 twister killed 22 people in Birmingham, said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in Montgomery.
Along a highway near a destroyed apartment complex, cars were flipped and smashed into telephone poles and crushed by trees.
The roadway was strewn with used bandages and medical gloves left by emergency workers treating the injured.
Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors had difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
Those in the tornado's path spoke with awe of its fury.
""It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of,"" said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car.
Heavy overhead power lines ""started snapping just like a circus performer would snap his whip,"" Carroll said.
""All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping over the top of us. ...
It was as if you were looking into an arc-welder, they were so bright.""
Kenneth Lenhard had undergone an operation at the Crestwood Hospital on Wednesday and returned to his room about an hour before a window in the next room blew out as the tornado passed.
""There wasn't anything I could do, so I covered my head,"" Lenhard said.
""I thought, `What the heck, I'm already half dead.' ""
The downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to rubble.
Kindergarteners were the only pupils left at the school by the time the twister hit.
The city is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space agency or weapons testing center.
At least two other tornadoes were reported in Alabama, injuring at least three people in addition to the Huntsville total.
Near Palmetto, Ga., resident Jeff Bryant said his home at the Sweetbriar Mobile Home Park near Interstate 85 began to vibrate when the twister approached.
""Then we heard a large, loud, swirling and humming noise,"" he recalled.
""It didn't sound like a train like everybody says it does.
I lived near a train track.
It did not sound like a train.
It sounded more like a jet aircraft at very close range.""
Thomas Farr was driving on Interstate 85 when the tornado hit.
""It was picking up cars and tossing them like toys off the interstate,"" he said.

Robert Moder said this morning that 463 people were injured by the twister, which plowed through a school and rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.
Police Chief Richard Ottman initially put the number of dead at 19, but his clerk, Kitty Whitworth, later said the death toll was lowered to 17 after police confirmed the count of bodies.
She said police had no firm reports of people missing.
No children in the school were killed, but about 30 youngsters were in a kindergarten class at the building, and five were reported injured.
Most of the dead were in apartments, stores or cars.
Mayor Steve Hettinger estimated the number of homeless at 1,000 and said officials were preparing a request for federal disaster assistance.
A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said 42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood of the survivors as ""shock, mostly, and disbelief.""
""They're thankful to be alive and they're thankful their families are alive,"" he said, adding that the shelter had received calls from around the country from worried relatives.
The tornado was Alabama's deadliest since a 1975 twister killed 22 people in Birmingham, said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in Montgomery.
Along a highway near a destroyed apartment complex, cars were flipped and smashed into telephone poles and crushed by trees.
The roadway was strewn with used bandages and medical gloves left by emergency workers treating the injured.
Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors had difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
Those in the tornado's path spoke with awe of its fury.

Executives from both companies say they're attempting to take advantage of the weeks of hype surrounding the game.
Both beermakers claim their packages are the largest Super Bowl promotions ever, with each planning to spend upwards of $7 million.
Anheuser Busch is staging a ""Bud Bowl II"" ad campaign that culminates during the Jan. 28 Super Bowl, with a game featuring animated teams of Budweiser and Bud Light beer bottles rattling around on a pint-sized football field.
The first such game was staged during the last Super Bowl.
""We're starting a month earlier, we've added an extra promo spot and we're going to have a lot more display materials in the stores,"" said Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser.
Miller, based in Milwaukee, won't say exactly how much it is spending on its 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on a football game between a ""Tastes Great"" team and a ""Less Filling"" squad.
Those teams will be made up of current and former National Football League players such as Bert Jones, L.C. Greenwood and Joe Klecko.
""We're spending more than $7 million, I can tell you that,"" said Richard Burton, advertising manager for Lite beer.
""We're talking about real-life talent.""
Miller's campaign culminates Jan. 14, two weeks before the Super Bowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowl television spots allocated for beer advertising.
Miller's television commercials already have started airing.
Anheuser Busch will begin its ads this week with a spot featuring sports announcer Brent Musberger.
Both companies also have fan participation promotions.
Anheuser Busch expects to receive 400,000 to 500,000 scorecards from fans who are being asked to write down the score of the Bud Bowl after each quarter.
Fans who send in their scorecards will receive a commemorative pin.

"The beer gridiron is going to be a busy and expensive place on television this January.
The nation's two largest brewers, Anheuser Busch Cos. Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., are gearing up to sell their beer with by staging mock football games in television commercials in conjunction with Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans.
Executives from both companies say they're attempting to take advantage of the weeks of hype surrounding the game.
Both beermakers claim their packages are the largest Super Bowl promotions ever, with each planning to spend upwards of $7 million.
Anheuser Busch is staging a ""Bud Bowl II"" ad campaign that culminates during the Jan. 28 Super Bowl, with a game featuring animated teams of Budweiser and Bud Light beer bottles rattling around on a pint-sized football field.
The first such game was staged during the last Super Bowl.
""We're starting a month earlier, we've added an extra promo spot and we're going to have a lot more display materials in the stores,"" said Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser.
Miller, based in Milwaukee, won't say exactly how much it is spending on its 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on a football game between a ""Tastes Great"" team and a ""Less Filling"" squad.
Those teams will be made up of current and former National Football League players such as Bert Jones, L.C. Greenwood and Joe Klecko.
""We're spending more than $7 million, I can tell you that,"" said Richard Burton, advertising manager for Lite beer.
""We're talking about real-life talent.""
Miller's campaign culminates Jan. 14, two weeks before the Super Bowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowl television spots allocated for beer advertising.
Miller's television commercials already have started airing.
Anheuser Busch will begin its ads this week with a spot featuring sports announcer Brent Musberger.
Both companies also have fan participation promotions.
Anheuser Busch expects to receive 400,000 to 500,000 scorecards from fans who are being asked to write down the score of the Bud Bowl after each quarter.
Fans who send in their scorecards will receive a commemorative pin.

"A form of blood cancer that strikes children appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published today.
The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a role in warding off the development of cancer.
The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous.
The researchers, based at the University of Chicago, found an association between loss of the genes and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood leukemia.
They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes.
Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
It adds to the growing list of cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of particular genes.
Some genes, known oncogenes, are though to trigger cancer.
Cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes, are missing.
Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's immune defenses and controlling cell growth.
The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes.
In the latest work, the researchers found that this section of the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
However, they left open the possibility that some other gene in this region besides those that make interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for about one-quarter of all childhood cancers.
It strikes one in every 30,000 children.","Cancer researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's production of interferon may play a role in warding off cancer development.

"Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype.
Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced.
Jurors found the pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13 other counts.
Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial.
""I just said, `I told you Ray,""' Mrs. Buckey said.
Asked if her son was surprised, she said.
""He had fear, definitely.""
Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer.
""If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to you, too.
If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be here today,"" she said.
But several parents of former students at the school said the Buckeys won because the system lost.
""It was never done properly,"" said parent Alan Lagunoff, who moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach.
""I have to sit back and figure out what to do with my son.
I fear that because of this verdict, no child will be seen as a credible witness from now on.""
His son, now 10, attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a witness at the trial.
""I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the courts.
It will just be another six-year travesty,"" Lagunoff said.
""The system is not going to protect children,"" said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case.
""I don't know what the message is that the jury wanted to get out.
I'm anxious to hear that.""
Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey, suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition.
""My concern primarily was Lael Rubin, who is `anything goes' in order to secure a conviction.
...
If you don't win, you don't get promoted,"" he said.
Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.
""Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,"" Ms. Williams told reporters.
Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail during the case, which defense attorneys said was the result of community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic mother of one child at the preschool.
Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election campaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the district attorney's office.
Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled the matter differently.
""Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am not going to take any public criticism directed at me.
Let him respond to the criticism,"" said Philibosian, now in private law practice.
Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to conduct the original interviews with the children.
Defense attorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researchers were leading and prejudicial.
Jurors agreed.
""We never got the children's stories in their own words,"" said juror John Breese.
Children's Institute officials didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.
Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of Raymond Buckey.
Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the case, which gained worldwide attention with its tales of underground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals.
The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as Reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants after reviewing the case.
The underground tunnels were never found.
No proof was ever produced of Satanic rituals.
Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long, expensive prosecution.
""It took far too long and cost far too much money to have what has been called perfect justice.
We need reform,"" Reiner said, adding that in trying to describe the case, ""Insane is the word that comes to mind.""
The case was the longest and the costliest in American judicial history, at 2{ years and $15 million.
Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50 witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.
For parents and others, there was more to ponder than legal questions.
""Life is not fair.
I tell my children all the time ...
there is no such thing as fair,"" said Robert Currie, whose son attended McMartin but didn't testify at the trial.

"Historians say the world need not fear that German jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but some still see the rush toward German reunification as a setback _
a step away from the integration of Europe.
For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsing into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united German state.
""The West Germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic fervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis,"" said Henry Ashby Turner of Yale, author of ""The Two Germanies Since 1945.""
""There is no such a thing as indelible national character,"" Turner said.
""I don't think there is any chance that the young men of Germany are going to slip out of their Adidas running shoes and pull on jackboots and start running around saying, `Heil!""
He was one of several experts in German history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the four World War II allies _
the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ to accept the reunification of a Germany they divided 45 years ago.
University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native of Germany, said he feared the creation of a ""strong, sovereign nation in the center of Europe"" could reverse a more important development _
the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe in which industries, banks, trade unions and even government ministries have been collaborating across borders.
""The East German state is collapsing,"" said Geyer.
""So something has to happen very dramatically.
But they have a choice _
the Europeans and Germans and Americans.
Do they want to opt for the European card or for the German card?
I think they are opting for the German card.""
""I hear these days very little about what Gorbachev called `the house of Europe,""' he said.
The result of a dominant ""uncomfortably strong"" German state, Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of national borders.
It could also mean, he said, that American troops might have to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany.
""If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after 1992, after the integration of the West German economy into the economy of Western Europe,"" said Charles J. Herber of George Washington University, expressing similar concern.
""Then there would have been fewer chances for German adventurers,"" he said.
West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings, said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presented reunification within the context of European integration.
They wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominating Europe.
""Even if the history did not exist, there would be fears of that kind,"" he said.
""We're dealing not just with rational calculation but a whole host of emotional memories.""
For all that, Breitman said, ""One Germany is not only inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos.""
""The only alternative to reunification,"" added Turner, is an East Germany in ruins, ""a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.""
He said Germans have ""no significant interest in territorial revisions.
Those misgivings are misplaced.""
Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considered a leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification, if mishandled, could prove explosive.
While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia, he said.
""I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but we have to give people _
and the Germans have to give people _ time to think this through and get used to it. ...
Mishandled, reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it would end.""
Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the division of Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement ""which worked pretty well"" but was ""abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected.""
German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance to build a new international system, one that ""will prevent the use of international violence.""
He added, ""We have to be careful that we don't fall back into the kind of system that existed before the Second World War, a Europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances, rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to be legitimate reasons but pitted against each other _ the sort of things that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.""","American historians agree that fears of a resurgent militaristic German State after reunification are baseless.
Most believe that a politically and economically collapsing East Germany represents a greater threat to world stability.
However, there is not agreement on how a unified Germany will affect its European neighbors and Soviet bloc countries.
A dominant German economy could slow or even reverse what has been emerging European economic integration.
Furthermore, while most West Europeans have gotten over nationalistic mistrusts, East Europeans living in closed societies have not.
One historian urges caution.
Reunification could prove explosive if mishandled.
West Germans are aware of their neighbors' misgivings.","[[0, 98], [215, 331], [2128, 2205], [3428, 3534], [3305, 3322], [3340, 3349], [3355, 3406], [2368, 2400], [2410, 2431]]"
"Historians say the world need not fear that German jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but some still see the rush toward German reunification as a setback _
a step away from the integration of Europe.
For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsing into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united German state.
""The West Germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic fervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis,"" said Henry Ashby Turner of Yale, author of ""The Two Germanies Since 1945.""
""There is no such a thing as indelible national character,"" Turner said.
""I don't think there is any chance that the young men of Germany are going to slip out of their Adidas running shoes and pull on jackboots and start running around saying, `Heil!""
He was one of several experts in German history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the four World War II allies _
the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ to accept the reunification of a Germany they divided 45 years ago.
University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native of Germany, said he feared the creation of a ""strong, sovereign nation in the center of Europe"" could reverse a more important development _
the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe in which industries, banks, trade unions and even government ministries have been collaborating across borders.
""The East German state is collapsing,"" said Geyer.
""So something has to happen very dramatically.
But they have a choice _
the Europeans and Germans and Americans.
Do they want to opt for the European card or for the German card?
I think they are opting for the German card.""
""I hear these days very little about what Gorbachev called `the house of Europe,""' he said.
The result of a dominant ""uncomfortably strong"" German state, Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of national borders.
It could also mean, he said, that American troops might have to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany.
""If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after 1992, after the integration of the West German economy into the economy of Western Europe,"" said Charles J. Herber of George Washington University, expressing similar concern.
""Then there would have been fewer chances for German adventurers,"" he said.
West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings, said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presented reunification within the context of European integration.
They wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominating Europe.
""Even if the history did not exist, there would be fears of that kind,"" he said.
""We're dealing not just with rational calculation but a whole host of emotional memories.""
For all that, Breitman said, ""One Germany is not only inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos.""
""The only alternative to reunification,"" added Turner, is an East Germany in ruins, ""a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.""
He said Germans have ""no significant interest in territorial revisions.
Those misgivings are misplaced.""
Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considered a leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification, if mishandled, could prove explosive.
While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia, he said.
""I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but we have to give people _
and the Germans have to give people _ time to think this through and get used to it. ...
Mishandled, reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it would end.""
Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the division of Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement ""which worked pretty well"" but was ""abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected.""
German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance to build a new international system, one that ""will prevent the use of international violence.""
He added, ""We have to be careful that we don't fall back into the kind of system that existed before the Second World War, a Europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances, rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to be legitimate reasons but pitted against each other _ the sort of things that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.""","Several German history experts discussed the implications of reunification after the Tuesday decision by the four World War II Allies decision to accept the reunification of a Germany they divided 45 years ago.
Most of the historians think that an East Germany moving toward chaos is a greater threat to stability than a United Germany.
They see Germany moving ahead not out of nationalistic fervor but as a way to deal with chaos.
One thought that it would be better not now in 1992, but after the West German economy had been integrated into the western European economy.","[[815, 956], [1017, 1083], [234, 358], [361, 364], [370, 433], [444, 470], [2054, 2205], [2208, 2230]]"
"In the two years since his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court was rejected, Robert Bork has found a new forum.
From his base at a conservative think tank he has become a best-selling author and he's soon to hit the lecture circuit.
No, he doesn't think he will ever get another shot at the high court.
By JOHN BARBOUR, AP Newsfeatures Writer : WASHINGTON (AP) : 
The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate is quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought.
Robert Heron Bork does not dwell on past disappointments.
In fact, he sees himself having a bigger impact on the law from the sidelines than he would have had from the bench.
He says he is taking his case to a higher court, the American public and the next generation.
One reason why is that Robert Bork, former Marine, former practicing lawyer, former Yale professor of law, former solicitor general, former professor at Yale again, former judge of the U.S. Circuit of Appeals, is now a best-selling writer.
To his surprise, ""The Tempting of America, The Political Seduction Of The Law,"" has been on the best-seller list for more than 10 weeks, and there are more than 190,000 copies in print.
Has that vindicated his views?
""I never felt the need for vindication,"" he says with a chuckle.
Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court in July 1987 and four months later the Democrat-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, after an often vitriolic debate, found him unfit for the job.
His strict constructionist views of the Constitution threatened the inclusion of women's rights under the 14th Amendment, and evoked a public outcry from blacks and labor.
In the political undercurrent it was also remembered that Bork as solicitor general dismissed special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Saturday Night Massacre in the Nixon administration.
Sitting in his office at the American Enterprise Institute, his back to his word processor, he briefly considers what might have been: ""I don't want to spend the rest of my life reliving it.
I have other things to do.""
He recalls the impact of a book he wrote a dozen years ago on antitrust law.
""A lot of people were good enough to say it had a great influence on moving antitrust laws from where they were to where they are now.""
""I hope in the same way to have some effect with this one,"" he says, pointing out the antitrust book had a greater impact than a few opinions he might have handed down from the bench.
""You know if you are on a court, you are one vote.
And you can't sit down and write 300 pages of connected argument to show why this is the right approach.
""I think this book has the chance to have more impact.
I think I am talking to the next generation.""
He says he has has received more than 200 letters from readers, some short, some long, some funny, some analytical, all supporting, he says.
The law reviews have yet to come out, but one university is planning four of them.
The book is also planned for paperback, which should reach a student audience.
Bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on the relationship of law and the culture.
He will hit the lecture circuit this spring and fall and will teach a constitutional law course next year at George Mason University.
Occasionally he writes magazine commentary articles.
Perhaps another shot at the court?
""I don't think so.
I don't think that's in the cards ...
The first time around when I was nominated for the Court of Appeals, the Senate approved me unanimously, as did the committee.""
But now he feels the Senate has taken a position on him that would preclude its backing down.
He relishes what free time he has.
He is catching up on reading he's not had a chance to do, making up for longtime neglect: Flexner's four volumes on Washington, English philosopher John Stuart Mill and his critics.
He and his wife, Mary Ellen, eschew most commercial television programs and rent videotapes instead.
""Popular culture as far as I'm concerned has gone straight downhill,"" Bork says.
During the hearings, Bork was astonished to learn that a radio reporter had gone to the video store he frequents and obtained a list of all of the tapes he had rented.
""I guess he was hoping for something really scandalous, but all he got was Fred Astaire and Cary Grant.""
There is now a law against giving out such lists.
At his bedside table are mysteries, his other pastime, Martha Grimes, Dorothy Sayers, John Dickson Carr, Margery Allingham.
But it's hard to follow a story when you read only four pages a night, he says.
The sedentary life has taken its toll.
Asked what his ideal weight would be, he smiles and offers an understatement, ""less than it is now.
I have to get myself back in shape so I can get back to tennis.
I used to like to ski
but I wouldn't dare now.""
He went skiing once when he was out of shape.
He was halfway down the slope, he says, ""when the muscles began to flutter and that's not very good because you have to get down the rest of the mountain.""
Bork enjoys the atmosphere at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank that has become his small university.
His colleagues include Irving Kristol, publisher of The National Interest, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, former State Department arms negotiator Richard Perle and political, economic and social commentators such as Ben Wattenberg, Michael Novak, Norman Ornstein and Walter Berns.
The institute does not make grave demands on its members.
There is an occasional brown-bag lunch where a speaker is brought in from the outside.
Bork, who abhored grading papers when he taught, says with a self-satisfied grin, ""It's a very good faculty, with no blue books.""
The faculty often gets together for dinner.
But, one suggests, given that many active minds around the dinner table, the soup must get cold.
""Not mine,"" says Bork.","Robert Bork, after being defeated as nominee to the Supreme Court, joined the American Enterprise Institute and then became a best selling author by authoring ""The Tempting of America.""
He believes this book on legal theory may have a positive effect on the views of future generations, even more so than decisions he may have made on the Supreme Court.
Are his views vindicated?
He said that he never felt the need for vindication.
He plans to write two more books, hit the lecture circuit, teach, write magazine commentary and catch up on his reading.
Beside mysteries are his other pastime.","[[17, 90], [164, 192], [1062, 1085], [1124, 1156], [1887, 1937], [602, 640], [652, 708], [2665, 2673], [2714, 2750], [1230, 1260], [1261, 1309], [3060, 3081], [3086, 3097], [3229, 3262], [3283, 3287], [3294, 3295], [3376, 3411], [3765, 3793], [4483, 4503]]"
"A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected, federal health researchers say.
In 1988, the last year for which complete statistics are available, 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported, down 0.4 percent from 1987, the national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
That slight drop compares with an average annual decrease of 6.7 percent from 1981 to 1984.
One reason for the slowing of progress in wiping out TB is ""the increasing occurrence of TB in persons infected with ... HIV,"" the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the CDC said.
AIDS leaves the body susceptible to a number of serious illnesses, including TB, and studies have found that about 4 percent of AIDS patients also are listed as TB patients.
If the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up through the late 1980s, an estimated 14,768 fewer TB cases would have been expected during 1985-1988, the CDC said in its weekly report.
Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, as compared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6 percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher rates of AIDS cases.
In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites, compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics.
The TB rate among blacks was 28.3 per 100,000, compared with 18.3 for Hispanics and 4.1 for whites.
Another 2,371 TB cases were reported among Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, for a rate of 36.3 per 100,000.
The CDC estimates that 10 million Americans are infected with the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, an infection of the lungs.
The vast majority will never become ill.
But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from tuberculosis, the CDC said.
In 1987, more than 115,000 Americans were under TB treatment: 20,000 new patients plus 95,000 people labeled high-risk and on preventive therapy.
Tuberculosis, which is curable in most cases with drug treatment, killed 1,755 Americans in 1987.","The National Centers for Disease Control reported data on tuberculosis showing 7,720 new cases in whites, 8,289 in blacks, 3,367 in Hispanics and another 2,371 in Asians and Pacific Islanders.
This represents a reversal in a trend in which tuberculosis was declining.
Much of the regression is caused by the occurrence of tuberculosis in AIDA patients.
Tuberculosis was up 9.1 percent in blacks and 17.6 percent in Hispanics, two groups with proportionally higher rates of AIDS.

and I was doing numbers, and I arrived in La Paz with a full-blown concept.""
What he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans.
The series of loans, starting at $50, is renewable over three years to a ceiling of $300, allowing recipients to reach a level at which they can qualify for commercial credit.
What Hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than 35,000 members.
Portfolios total $1.6 million, with a 96 percent repayment rate.
Village banks are operating in Mexico, Haiti, Thailand, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Peru and El Salvador.
The concept is similar to the one behind the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh: channeling money to the impoverished, principally mothers, without the demands of commercial banks for collateral, so they can improve their families' lives.
What Hatch foresees is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics.
Hatch, a one-time Peace Corps volunteer with a doctorate in economic development, is founder and president of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance, which recently moved its headquarters from Tucson to Alexandria, Va.
He says its impetus was, and remains, the thousands of children worldwide who die daily because of starvation, what he calls the sacrifice of ""probably our most precious resource.""
Hatch focuses on reaching mothers in the belief that strengthening them economically lets them care for their children better.
There is ""almost a 100 percent guarantee"" that increased income for women will go into improvements in their children's welfare, Hatch says.
""We teach severely poor mothers how to create their own self-managed bank, which provides them with self-employment loans, provides them with savings incentives and provides them with a support group of mothers like themselves, so that they are all attacking change at the same time.""
Lawrence Yanovitch, small enterprise development program coordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore, Md., says, ""John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor.
Though he's come up with some sophisticated economic tools, he's kept the humanitarianism.""
Catholic Relief Services entered a five-year, $1 million joint venture a year ago with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the foundation to create 40 village banks in Thailand.
They targeted microenterprise development through small entrepreneurs, vendors, village market women, who in some developing countries comprise up to 50 percent of the employment.
Capitalization for one bank typically will cost a sponsoring agency $5,000.
Beryl Rupp, a Rotary Club official in Phoenix, says the bank members buy necessities with their profits or savings: a chair to sit on, pots to cook in, blankets, better food.
The women, when asked, speak of the greatest benefit in terms of what Hatch calls ""empowerment perceptions.""
""They say things like, `Now I'm somebody,' or `My husband respects me more.""'
Their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can earn enough to provide savings and create capital.
Hatch says the loans give them freedom to start their own investment projects in or near home.
The foundation will go into a village with a joint-venture partner that puts up at least half of the capitalization, such as Rotary Clubs or Catholic Relief Services, and identify a key woman.
She then contacts others to attend an organizing meeting.
""Forget the mayor, forget the priest, forget the chief,"" Hatch says.
""We want to know who the most powerful woman is in that village.""
At the meeting, the women circle illustrated examples of quick-turnover work they want the loans to finance.
It might be selling produce, groceries, baked goods, raising chickens, sewing or craftwork.
Each woman signs her name or provides a thumbprint as collateral, agreeing to repay one-sixteenth of the loan weekly, plus interest of 1 percent to 3 percent, in line with local banks.
In some countries, the repayment rate has been 100 percent.
Overall, the average is 97 percent, says Hatch.
""Fifty percent or more are illiterate, and I would say 90 percent of them don't have any idea of what they're getting into when we start out,"" says Hatch.
""And yet within 16 weeks they're all experts.
They just learn as they go.""
Women who join the bank screen members and elect their leaders from first-meeting attendees.
At the end of the 16th week, each member's loan balance is zero.
But at the same time, each woman has been depositing weekly savings of at least 20 percent of the original loan.
The savings serve as incentive for subsequent loans by increasing the credit line each time, Hatch said.
Interest in village banking is mounting.
The United Nations has provided a $50,000 grant to research the effects of women's empowerment through village banking on maternal and child health practices.
The foundation has major proposals pending with the Agency for International Development, the Ford Foundation, Citibank and the Chase Manhattan Bank, among others.
Rotary Club 100, a Phoenix organization, and a Rotary Club of Mexico City are in a joint venture, having funded five village banks in Guaymas, Mexico, with another four to be launched in the slums of Mexico City.
Hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in reducing poverty along the Mexican border and in slowing down migration to this country.
As for whether such a system could work in the United States, Rotary's Rupp says, ""Frankly, it's the only hope we have of changing the welfare system.""
""Ultimately the way out of poverty is savings,"" Hatch adds.

The nomination finally was approved in September 1987.
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's Marxist government.

"Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
The countdown began Saturday afternoon for a launch set for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes well, the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend.
""We are as excited, maybe even more.
You can cut it with a knife, incredible,"" said Eric Chaisson, senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original 1983 launch date.
As Chaisson remarked last week: ""The universe has been around for 15 billion years.
A couple of weeks is not going to matter.""
""The heavens look the same to me.
The secrets are the same,"" Chaisson said.
""There's not a bit of difference,"" agreed Charles Pellerin Jr., NASA's director of astrophysics.
""I think the main point is the Hubble Space Telescope still is in perfect condition.""
The $1.5 billion telescope, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built, rests safely inside Discovery's payload bay awaiting the Tuesday launch.
If all goes well, Discovery will return to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Sunday, April 29, with an empty payload bay.
NASA said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _
as early as that same day.
After the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
The observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
It also is considered by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date; it will be the 35th.
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is expanding.
His work gave rise to the theory the universe was created by a tremendous explosion about 15 billion years ago.
From its perch far above Earth's obstructing atmosphere, the telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
Astronomers are counting on Hubble to unravel some of the mystery surrounding quasars, pulsars and black holes.
By studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years, they hope to determine the precise origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems _ and life forms _ exist.
""If everything goes well, it's going to knock our socks off,"" Chaisson said.
NASA's sole attempt to launch Discovery was halted four minutes before liftoff April 10 when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units failed.
The 88-pound unit was replaced with a new one, the first time NASA ever had installed such a unit at the launch pad.
The procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last week to advance the launch to Tuesday, a day earlier than planned.
Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries were returned to the telescope Friday following 130 hours of recharging.
The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are deployed 380 miles above Earth, the highest a shuttle has ever gone.
Astronaut Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space on the second day of the mission.
The telescope's aperture door will be opened on the next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan, veteran spacewalkers, will leave the cabin to assist if necessary.
The shuttle will follow Hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to Earth.
""You can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or gremlins that may sneak up on any given day,"" Sullivan said.
""But those are very remote potentials I really suspect we won't encounter.""
In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of the telescope, $500 million has been spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts and develop computer software to operate the instrument.
The European Space Agency contributed $250 million to the Hubble project and will get to use the telescope 15 percent of the time.","The countdown began Saturday for launching of Space Shuttle Discovery on its mission of hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into orbit above the earth's atmosphere.
Launch is scheduled for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
The $1.5 billion telescope is expected to start providing significant scientific data in a month or two.
HST is considered to be the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
It may help test the theory arising from the work of Edwin P. Hubble, for whom it is named, that the ever expanding universe was created by a tremendous explosion some 15 billion years ago.","[[53, 84], [119, 164], [210, 238], [249, 261], [2231, 2258], [2271, 2281], [253, 291], [1169, 1195], [1663, 1759], [1761, 1869], [1980, 2006], [2027, 2042], [2076, 2112], [2114, 2224]]"
"Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again because it's posing new health threats with its connection to the AIDS virus.
A 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in Newark, N.J., has caught the attention of health officials, who had been previously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in TB cases over the last few decades.
They attribute the 5 percent national increase in TB cases in 1989 to the ravages of the AIDS virus, which destroys the body's immune system and leaves victims open to TB infection, Dr. Philip C. Hopewell of San Francisco General Hospital said Sunday.
Hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between AIDS and TB during the a four-day World Conference on Lung Health in Boston, which ends Wednesday.
About 4 percent of Americans identified as having the AIDS virus also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said Dr. Dixie E. Snider Jr., director of the division of tuberculosis control at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The American Lung Association estimates that 20,000 Americans a year develop TB.
In parts of Africa, where AIDS is already a health risk, tuberculosis has become epidemic, said Dr. Annik Rouillon, executive director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease in Paris.
""The combination of the two is really catastrophic,"" she said.
Snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike AIDS, is a curable disease and called for TB screenings at drug rehabilitation programs, prisons or other places where AIDS tests are being administered.
Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all persons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be readily diagnosed in AIDS patients.
""It's important we get control of the situation,"" he said.
In Wyoming, the Centers for Disease Control recorded no new cases of TB in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can be controlled and cured, according to Dr. Lee B. Reichman, director of the pulmonary division of the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey.
""I have never heard of a rise of the magnitude seen in New Jersey or, on the other hand, the hope generated by no cases in one state,"" Reichman said.
Moreover, unlike AIDS, TB is a highly contagious disease that can be spread by airborne particles coughed up by a person with untreated, clinically active pulmonary TB.
Untreated, tuberculosis kills about 50 percent of its victims within two years, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Snider said sustained contact is necessary for TB transmission, and would not pose new problems for AIDS victims already fighting discrimination in jobs and housing.
However, he noted that there had been an increase in positive TB tests among AIDS health workers.
Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium that commonly affects the lungs but can attack almost any organ.
For the last three decades, it has been preventable and curable through multiple drug therapy, Snider said.
Snider said 10 million to 15 million Americans have been infected with the tuberculosis germ, but only a small percentage of them develop the disease because their immune system was strong enough to prevent the disease from developing.
If, however, a person's immune system is impaired by poor nutrition or weakened by the HIV virus, people can develop active TB.
""TB is long known as an opportunistic organism,"" Hopewell said.
The doctors said U.S. minority groups have become increasing susceptible to TB.
Snider said there has been a 150 percent increased in cases of TB among young blacks in New York City.
Tuberculosis can be effectively treated, even in AIDS patients, underscoring efforts to screen persons for the disease, the doctor said.
Reichman noted that most American have forgotten about the problems of TB; from 1981 to 1984, TB cases declined an average of 6 percent per year according to the Centers for disease control.
But, he said, ""TB is back with a vengeance.""
While associated with poverty and crowded living conditions, TB through history has ravaged both the poor and the famous.
TB victims include Henry David Thoreau, Washington Irving, Franz Kafka, Ring Lardner, Somerset Maugham and Vivien Leigh.
An estimated 3 million persons a year die worldwide from TB, according to the American Lung Association.","Health officials met in Boston for a four day World Conference on Lung Health.
In parts of Africa, where AIDS has been a health risk, tuberculosis is running rampant.
The combination of the two is catastrophic.
Within the United States there has been a five percent increase in the number of reported cases, but the numbers vary widely from state to state.
No new cases were reported in Wyoming for all of 1989.
Newark, New Jersey saw a 35 percent increase in tuberculosis, and in New York City there has been a 150 percent increase among blacks.","[[621, 637], [688, 740], [1098, 1187], [1309, 1358], [365, 408], [1784, 1794], [1837, 1863], [126, 166], [175, 187], [3504, 3563], [3570, 3593]]"

Her remarks raised tensions further between India and Pakistan, which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir.
The two countries, which have fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965, have in recent weeks again built up their military forces near the common border.
""India is indulging in genocide,"" Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
""Islamic scholars are being killed and innocent people are being slaughtered.

Hindu-dominated India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri militants fighting for secession of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Moslem majority.
Pakistan, which is dominated by Moslems, denies the Indian charge.
Since the Indian government ordered a crackdown on the militants in late January, more than 400 people have been killed.

"The candidate backed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev for president of the Russian republic withdrew from the race today, strengthening the campaign of Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist who has repeatedly clashed with Gorbachev.
The state news agency Tass reported the withrawal of Russian Premier Aleksandr V. Vlasov but did not give a reason.
It said Vlasov's pullout had been announced at the Congress of the Russian Federation, which will elect the president, a newly created post in the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
On Wednesday, Gorbachev attacked Yeltsin's platform, accusing him of calling for the ""breakup of the Soviet Union.""
The Russian republic contains Moscow and encompasses 11 time zones, from the Baltic to the Pacific.
The Russian language predominates in the Soviet Union, and much of the nation's wealth, including vast natural resources, is concentrated in the republic.
In addition to Yeltsin, two other men remained in the race _
Ivan Polozkov and Vladimir Morokin _
but from the start the campaign had appeared to be a contest between Yeltsin and Vlasov.
A vote was possible later in the day.
Prior to Vlasov's announcement, Yeltsin delivered a well-received speech pledging that if elected, he would defend the republic from meddling by the national Soviet government, but refrain from clashing with Gorbachev.
Gorbachev holds the posts of president of the Soviet Union and general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, the two most powerful jobs in the Soviet Union.
""I am for businesslike relations, dialogue and negotiations with the president and the government, but on the principle that Russia's sovereignty is not damaged,"" Yeltsin told the Russian Congress.
His bass voice booming through the hall of the Great Kremlin Palace, Yeltsin pressed a radical platform for bringing the Russian republic ""out of crisis.""
He presented a point-by-point program on how he would fight for Russian's sovereignty, unleash market forces, increase housing and flood stores with consumer goods.
He blasted the government program for a transition to a market economy presented by Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov on Thursday, saying it had ""already created panic in the stores today.""
Instead, he backed an alternative program involving sale of government property, more liberal laws on ownership and foreign loans to make the transition without ""everything falling on the shoulders of the people.""
Yeltsin already is a member of the Congress of People's Deputies, which is the national parliament; the Russian Congress of People's Deputies, the Russian republic's parliament; and the Communist Party Central Committee.
During a question-and-answer session, he was asked several times about his relations with Gorbachev, who entered the hall halfway through the speech.
Yeltsin, formerly Gorbachev's protege, has become an opponent in the last two years, blaming the Soviet president for ""halfway reforms.""
But Yeltsin said their personal relationship would not influence their interaction as presidents.
""If there was or is something personal, I'll set it aside,"" he said.
Yeltsin left the podium to prolonged applause, and was followed by Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief from Krasnodar who is now considered Yeltsin's main rival.

"A natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
""TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack,"" said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor at Jefferson.
Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts.
In 12 of the rats, the researchers injected a placebo.
In the other 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.
For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, ""the damage from the attack was much less severe.
There was about 50 percent less injury with TGF beta than without it.""
The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.
Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer.
Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage.
Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
Narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack.
TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack.
Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by Genentech, a California biotechnology firm.
Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away.
Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
Science, which published the study, is the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.","A natural substance called transforming growth factor (TGF) beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.

Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts.
In 12 of the rats, the researchers injected a placebo.
In the other 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.
For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, ""the damage from the attack was much less severe.
There was about 50 percent less injury with TGF beta than without it.""
The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.
Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer.
Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage.
Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
Narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack.
TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack.
Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by Genentech, a California biotechnology firm.
Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away.
Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
Science, which published the study, is the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.","According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.
In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections.
TGF beta is normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the simulated heart attack.

"An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant drawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.
In the operation, doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed.
This reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.
The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.
During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 percent.
In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, it was 39 percent.
Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
""It has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack,"" Buchwald said.
""It is eminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy, including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack.""
Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinal obstructions.
The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts.
Although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question.
""It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid (cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered,"" Buchwald said.
""It is a very powerful study and should, except for certain people who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterol controversy.""
In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people were treated with diet alone.
At the start of the study, their average cholesterol levels were 251.
The surgery lowered people's cholesterol 23 percent.
The overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts.
The surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries.","An operation to lower the cholesterol levels of heart attack patients reduced their risk of another heart attack or death from heart disease.
In the operation, called ileal bypass, one third of the small intestine is bypassed.
This reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed into the bloodstream.
The operation has one significant drawback, it causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.
Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol drugs, doubts remained about whether lower cholesterol actually helped people to live longer.
This offers the strongest justification for marked cholesterol lowering that has ever been offered, according to one researcher.","[[0, 2], [14, 145], [401, 477], [171, 213], [343, 362], [372, 399], [215, 295], [1637, 1684], [1686, 1750], [1951, 1999], [2007, 2018], [2020, 2059], [2062, 2075]]"
"An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant drawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.
In the operation, doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed.
This reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.
The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.
During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 percent.
In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, it was 39 percent.
Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
""It has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack,"" Buchwald said.
""It is eminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy, including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack.""
Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinal obstructions.
The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts.

"Eight years after a volcano scare incited fear, anger and economic gloom in Sierra resorts, residents are nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes.
Scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic eruption.
But most of the quakes are too small to be felt, so ""you don't really think about it,"" said Pam Murphy, spokeswoman for Mammoth Mountain Ski Area.
""You can get hit by a car,"" she said.
""You can be in a plane crash.
The chances of those are a lot higher than the chance of being killed by an earthquake or a volcano.""
""People who are frightened left long ago.
I don't believe it's a conscious concern of anyone in the community,"" said Mammoth Lakes Mayor Gordon Alper.
The resort town's 4,700 permanent residents live in Long Valley, a 19-mile-long, 9-mile-wide volcanic crater known as a caldera.
It is located on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada range 250 miles north of Los Angeles.
The Earth's crust is being stretched apart in the region, allowing molten rock to fill half-mile-wide chambers under the caldera.
The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most powerful eruptions, a blast that spewed 600 times more material than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state.
Eruptions somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens' happened 550 years ago at the Inyo craters, which span Long Valley's north rim, and 650 years ago at the Mono craters, several miles north of the caldera.
Despite the current activity, the probability of a major earthquake or a volcanic eruption in the area is ""less than 1 percent each year,"" said David Hill, the U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley.
Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck called such estimates ""a scientific guessing game,"" and said area residents rarely discuss the latest swarm of earthquakes, which started in May 1989.
That low-key attitude contrasts with feelings of anxiety, denial and hostility when thousands of quakes - some exceeding 6 on the Richter scale - rocked the area from 1979 to 1984.
During that period, subterranean molten rock pushed upward, lifting the caldera's floor.
As a result, the Geological Survey issued a ""notice of potential volcanic hazard"" for Long Valley in May 1982.
That warning, coupled with jarring earthquakes, damaged tourism and aggravated a recession in the once-booming real estate market.
""The community overreacted,"" Murphy said.
Residents accused journalists of sensationalizing the possibility of an eruption and denounced scientists for scaring people.
""Initially we thought this was a big ploy for them to get funding from Congress,"" Alper said.
The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 after the beleaguered Geological Survey changed its warning system and seismic activity diminished, reducing the possibility of an eruption.
Swarms of thousands of small quakes resumed 18 months ago and continue to rattle Mammoth Lakes, June Lake, Lee Vining and other Mono County resort towns.
The temblors, most measuring 1 to 3 on the Richter scale, started beneath Mammoth Mountain.
In September 1989, they shifted to the caldera, where five to 10 small quakes now happen daily.
A quake estimated at 5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale shook the region last Tuesday, tumbling rocks onto Yosemite National Park's roads.
It was eastern California's largest quake since 1984, but wasn't related to volcanic activity that causes the quake swarms, Hill said.
Long Valley's floor continues to bulge upward as molten rock moves inside two or three chambers about four miles under the caldera, he said.
The caldera floor rose about 2 feet since 1979, including 3 inches in the past year.
While Long Valley ""is clearly an area that's showing unrest, large calderas can do these kinds of things over years to decades without necessarily erupting,"" Hill said.
The floor of a caldera near Naples, Italy, rose 9 feet between 1970 and 1984 but didn't erupt.
Comparable uplift inside a New Guinea caldera also failed to produce volcanic disaster.
Nevertheless, Hill said, eastern Sierra residents are addressing the volcanic threat by developing or revising emergency plans and helping the Geological Survey prepare a new system to issue a warning if an eruption appeared likely.","California's Long Valley is a 19-mile caldera created 730,000 years ago by an eruption 600 times larger than Mount St. Helens.
In May 1989, new underground lava movement began triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes and raising the valley floor.
Residents refuse to heed warnings, remembering a 1982 false alarm that damaged tourism and aggravated a recession.
Afterward, journalists were accused of sensationalism and scientists of scaring people to get more funding.
Currently, 5-10 small quakes happen daily as the Earth's crust is stretched apart and magma fills half-mile-wide chambers four miles under the caldera, but the probability of eruption is less than one percent.","[[795, 822], [863, 870], [1093, 1136], [1166, 1175], [1185, 1229], [1239, 1267], [123, 205], [1856, 1887], [1895, 1914], [2291, 2295], [2302, 2309], [2345, 2387], [2470, 2594], [2607, 2661], [3171, 3211], [1524, 1542], [1576, 1584], [1597, 1620], [963, 1005], [1021, 1091], [3569, 3612]]"

"For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher was regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies.
Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in 1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya.
In the Persian Gulf crisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to the Middle East.
""You always know where she was and what she believed,"" Bush said upon hearing of her decision to resign.

Mrs. Thatcher wasn't one of the skeptics; she was advocating a similar program at home.
They shared rocky relations with organized labor.
Reagan successfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers, dealing a devastating blow to labor.
She, too, smashed restive unions.
On foreign policy, she frequently was more right wing than Reagan - certainly more so than Bush.
Reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the British prime minister.
They were ideological soulmates and called each other Ronnie and Margaret.
At international gatherings, they usually were side by side.
Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan left office, the president said he was leaving the White House with ""considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.""
She later wrote him a ""Dear Ron"" letter in which she praised him as ""a great president, one of the greatest.""
Like Reagan, she was deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.
Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championed military readiness - even though she was the first to recognize Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a leader she could do business with.
Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan nurtured under the theme of peace through strength.
She was a big backer of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe and always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came to disarmament.
When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland Islands, the United States was forced to make a painful choice between two allies.
Ronnie sided with Margaret.
Washington's special relationship with London seemed to slip when Reagan left power.
Bush and Mrs. Thatcher disagreed publicly last year over her government's decision to deport Vietnamese and Cambodian ""boat people"" who were fleeing their countries to Hong Kong.
Bush, a veteran of world politics, knew many leaders around the globe.
Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.
The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush found German Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.
She was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the prized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.
Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the ""special relationship"" between the United States and Great Britain to remain on a ""steady keel.""
Mrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty.
For awhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of Gorbachev's unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in Europe, and appeared uncertain how to respond.
Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to the Soviet leader.
Now they seem almost best of friends.
On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possible military force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his threat credible.
Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, was tougher.
She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, the West would have to use military force to dislodge him.
She called Saddam ""a loser,"" and the state-controlled Iraqi news agency replied that she was an ""old hag.""
Now, she is leaving.
No one suspects that Britain's new leadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.
Yet, if the going gets tough, it might have been comforting for Bush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher.","Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, considered America's best friend for almost a decade, has decided to retire.
President Bush called her an outstanding ally of the United States.
Her closest ties, however, were with former President Reagan..
They were ideological soul mates who were usually side by side at international gatherings.
Calling each other Ronnie and Margaret, they shared similar political and economic views.
During the British clash with Argentina, the United States was forced to choose between two allies.
President Bush was more experienced in world politics and knew many world leaders and Mrs. Thatcher became just one of the gang.","[[0, 95], [459, 468], [510, 580], [1224, 1255], [1299, 1358], [1260, 1297], [2232, 2266], [2305, 2336], [2352, 2377], [2671, 2740], [2742, 2798]]"
"Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association has filed a $6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk bonds in the 1980s.
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan, claims that Milken and others manipulated and coerced Columbia and other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky high-yield bonds.
""Absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan institutions,"" the suit says.
Columbia once was a major Drexel customer.
It holds a junk bond portfolio with a face value of over $4 billion, the largest of any thrift.
Milken had a close business relationship with former Columbia chairman Thomas Spiegel, who resigned last year.
Milken, the former head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based junk bond department, was sentenced last month to 10 years in prison for six felonies related to illegal trading practices.
None of the charges involved junk bonds.
The lawsuit by Columbia, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, names Milken, nine other Drexel officials and more than 100 investment partnerships sponsored by the collapsed Wall Street firm.
It alleges that the thrift lost more than $2 billion on investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under federal racketeering and antitrust laws.
Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, said in the lawsuit that Milken and other Drexel officials manipulated, coerced and deceived the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain active and the thrift would make money.
In a statement, a spokesman for Milken said the lawsuit was without merit.
The statement said Columbia was an independent institution that made its own investment decisions, often in disagreement with Milken.
""It is outrageous now to blame Michael Milken for losses as a result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after he was no longer active at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and which he did not endorse or agree with,"" the statement said.
Milken resigned from Drexel last year but the statement said he had gradually reduced his day-to-day activity after he was linked to the government's Wall Street investigation in late 1986.
It said the lawsuit amounts to ""shifting the blame to the most convenient scapegoat on the financial scene - Michael Milken - who has been blamed for every problem facing the U.S. economy except the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.""
The lawsuit joins scores of other civil complaints against Milken for alleged wrongdoing related to his guilty plea as well as other trading activity during his tenure at Drexel, which is now in federal bankruptcy court proceedings.
The 176-page lawsuit by Columbia also claims that Milken and other Drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for themselves via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond buyers in the deals.
The suit accuses Milken and others of manipulating the junk bond market, giving bribes and stock investment opportunities to some thrift executives, misappropriating valuable stock interests in junk bond deals, skimming profits from junk bond trading, and controlling through illegal means a web of thrifts and other investors in junk bonds.
Columbia was one of many savings and loans, big investors and other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or supported by Drexel in the 1980s.
Columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face value of $4.3 billion, but that it has written down their value to $2.5 billion to account for the decline in their market price.
It also says it has suffered actual losses of $200 million through the sale of some bonds.
The suit says Columbia was ""ill-equipped"" to make use of relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds.
It alleges that Milken and the others exploited this weakness.
The savings and loan is expected to be take over soon by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as part of the nation's costly thrift bailout.
The FDIC and Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the failed thrifts, already have filed a claim for $4.5 billion against Drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk bond dealings caused Columbia heavy losses.
Also named in the Milken lawsuit are former Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph; Milken's brother, Lowell, also a former Drexel executive; Peter Ackerman, Drexel's former chief of capital markets; and other officials.
As part of his settlement of criminal and civil charges by the government, Milken has agreed to place $400 million in a fund to compensate investors harmed by his actions.
But he would remain liable for awards exceeding the amount in the fund.","Columbia Savings & Loan Association has filed a $6 billion civil lawsuit against Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert officials.

"Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language.
The republic's parliament acted in response to a decree issued on Dec. 22 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official news agency Tass reported.
Gorbachev also gave the republic 10 days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders.
Tass said the Moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that Gorbachev said restricted the rights of minorities.
Ethnic tension has gripped Moldavia, a largely agricultural republic bordering Romania, during its push for independence from the Soviet Union this year.
The unrest turned violent last month, when government troops clashed with activists, leaving four dead.
Gorbachev said the conflicts had reached ""critical levels,"" and he put part of the blame on the Moldavian Supreme Soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities.
Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism, two of the republic's minority groups have begun their own separatist movements.
The Gagauz, a group of about 150,000 Turkish Christians, declared a new republic in southern Moldavia.
In the eastern part of Moldavia, more than 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have joined in declaring a new republic along the Dneister River.
All three groups claim discrimination by Moldavians.
In particular, they resent a new law making Moldavian the official language and requiring people in dozens of jobs ranging from doctors to hairdressers to pass Moldavian language tests by 1995.

Gorbachev said the declaration of the Gagauz and Dniester republics was illegal under the Soviet and Moldavian constitutions, as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies.
The Moldavian legislature has also voted to declare the elections null and void.
After residents of the Gagauz region began holding local elections in late October, the Moldavian legislature clamped a two-month state of emergency on the region, restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rallies.

Once the second man in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, he also served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, and a European nation.
His choice for the new job signals the importance the United States attaches to Jordan in terms of inter-Arab politics and the Arab-Israeli dispute.
Before Egan's appointment became final, he had to go through a grueling test in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Daniel Moynihan, the Zionist Democrat from New York, presided over the hearing that scrutinized the would-be ambassador's credentials and went on to confirm his nomination.
In his testimony, Egan told the hearing he would work to develop relations between the United States and Jordan and enhance Jordan's role in the peace process.
He pointed out that Jordan signed a joint agenda with Israel that will presumably culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries.
His said his top priority in Amman will be to propel the peace process forward and recognize Jordan's energetic role in the effort to bring about a comprehensive Middle East peace.

Discussing the West Bank and Gaza, he dismissed as inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied territories, and asked: If these are occupied territories, who were they occupied by?
These territories, contended the senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state of Israel.
What Israel did was to take the West Bank from Jordan the way it took Gaza from Egypt.
Previously, these territories were part of the British mandate, and before that they fell within the realm of the Ottoman Empire.
Mr. Moynihan's point, in other words, is that these territories are up for grabs.
The United States, he noted, never recognized Jordan's sovereignty over the West Bank.
His bottom line: Israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's sovereignty.
This Zionist senator's remarks are not supposed to be Washington's official line.

" Patten Poses Seven Challenges to China in Second Annual Report--Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to China [passage omitted] 1.
Abandoning his ""from politics to politics"" stance, which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, Patten has now woven politics into the lives of the people of Hong Kong, making it part and parcel of the local way of life and inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, freedom, education, and the quality of governance -- all ""perennial concerns"" in Chinese society.
[passage omitted] The way Christopher Patten talked last year, you would have thought he were in Britain.
Now Patten takes life in Hong Kong as his point of departure, arguing that democratic politics of a high quality are what the people of Hong Kong need to maintain the ""Hong Kong system.""
How can the Chinese authorities be persuasive if they reject his argument?
What alternative can the Chinese offer?
If the Chinese come up with their own agenda, what must it contain that would invalidate the British position?
How to sever the linkage between ""politics"" and the ""Hong Kong way of life?""
When Hong Kong fought for democracy in the 1980's, Xu Jiatun [6079 1367 1470] tried countering Hong Kong's capitalist primary democracy with advanced socialist democracy.
Subsequently China rejected Hong Kong's political demands by questioning their timetable.
After Patten came to Hong Kong, the Chinese could no longer keep acting anti-democratic.
All they could do was to declare that they too were for democracy but that the dispute between China and Britain is not one over the extent of democracy but one involving trust between two nations.
Now that Patten has made politics an integral part of the life of the Hong Kong people and their institutions, can the Chinese continue to counter it with the argument that it is all a matter of trust between nations?
2.
In contrast to his past arrogance and wilfulness, Patten now says, ""I have grown to like Hong Kong more and more.
I have deep feelings for this place.""
He hopes that ""as it advances with big strides into the 21st century, Hong Kong will be like a beacon, shining brightly as if to announce its glorious achievements.
It will also set an excellent example demonstrating that in a system of freedom, people can successfully overcome all sorts of adversity and difficulties and, hand in hand, create a wonderful future.""
(Section 190) After the governor presented his first annual report to the Legislative Council last year, the Chinese authorities initially took a heavy-handed approach.
It was so severe and threatening that it gave the impression China was prepared for mutual destruction, with Britain, Hong Kong, and itself all going down the tube.
In doing so, the Chinese only succeeded in turning public opinion strongly against them.
Even as public approval of Patten slipped and opposition rose, anti-Chinese feelings in Hong Kong also gained ground.
Politically speaking, the Chinese paid dearly for opposing Patten.
At the time the Chinese could convincingly attack Patten for his overbearing ways, arrogant, domineering, stubborn, and intractable.
Now Patten has changed his attitudes.
He may still be impenetrably thick-headed, but he has mellowed considerably and become more practical.
What should be China's attitude now?
If the Chinese try to be as mellow and practical as Patten, that may be interpreted as a compromise.
Yet if they persist in their shrill ways, they may lose points.
3.
Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council is replete with praises for the people of Hong Kong, for their accomplishments, and for the superiority of the Hong Kong system, calling it a miracle of human society.
The report also contains endless comparisons with Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, countries which the local people are familiar with.
Of course this is the stock in trade of politicians in every democratic country, but it also shows that the relationship between the ruler and the ruled under a democratic system is just what the people of Hong Kong need psychologically at this point in time.
Having inherited the tradition of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, the Chinese Communists have always considered Hong Kong alien land.
It is hard for the Chinese to sing the praises of the Hong Kong system, Hong Kong people, and Hong Kong society.
During the anti-Patten campaign last year, the Chinese opposed everything that was associated with Patten.
What Patten said about Hong Kong's values and its superiority were all satirized by the Chinese media, so much so that one could hardly tell right from wrong anymore.
The ""anti-Patten"" campaign came perilously close to being an ""anti-Hong Kong"" movement.
The objective of the Chinese was to launch an all-out attack on Patten, stopping at nothing.
In so doing, however, they in effect repudiated many of the values of the system of Hong Kong.
If China continues its negative attitude toward Hong Kong, what sort of price will it have to pay?
If, on the other hand, it echoes Patten and begins heaping praises on Hong Kong and emulating the Hong Kong system, can the Chinese Government bring itself to do that?
Would praising Hong Kong send a wrong message to the local people, misleading them into thinking that China would compromise with Patten and go along with him?
Would that encourage ""Hong Kong chauvinism?""
4.
Patten has modified his political reform proposals in two major ways.
First, he has replaced functional groups with statutory bodies even as he insists that voting be based on the individual and reduces the overall number of voters from the 2.70 million called for last year to 1 million.
The second concession is that the electoral committee would be composed of four groups following the organizational model of the second legislative council after 1997 as spelled out in the Basic Law.
Under Patten's original proposal, the committee was to be made up of popularly elected district representatives (in its entirety or to a large extent).
Nevertheless, Patten sticks by his original plan to have the 400 members of the electoral committee be chosen through election.
Moreover, this concession comes with strings attached; the proposal that elected representatives be allowed to serve out their terms beyond 1997 (the ""through train"" concept) is part and parcel of his overall plan.
Britain and China reopened negotiations in April mainly because public opinion forced them back to the conference table.
Both sides knew full well the price of defying public wishes.
They may not reach an agreement if they negotiate, but they are bound to lose if they don't even talk.
Hong Kong people hope that something will come out of their talks.
A dozen or so public opinion surveys by the Hong Kong Statistical and Business Research Council invariably came up with one finding: The people of Hong Kong want both sides to make concessions and reach an accord.
Now that Patten has made the first move by taking the initiative to give way, naturally the public wants the Chinese side to make corresponding concessions in order to narrow the difference between the two sides.
How should the Chinese Government respond?
If they continue to insist that Patten is guilty of the ""three violations"" and refuse to make adjustments and concessions, they would have a lot of ideological work to do on the Hong Kong people, besides giving Patten a reason to withdraw from the talks.
However, if they give way, they would be handing a victory to Patten.
Patten's initial demand was an electorate of 2.7 million people.
It has now been scaled back to 1 million, still significantly more than the 200,000-300,000 people who would have been eligible to cast votes for the original 21 functional seats.
How extensive a concession should the Chinese make?
What about the ""through train"" proposal?
As the seven letters between the foreign ministers indicate, both sides agreed that the same electoral arrangements should remain in place from 1995 through 1999, allowing legislators elected in 1995 to serve out their terms through 1999.
Then came the 4 June tragedy of 1989 and the big victories scored by democratic groups in direct Legislative Council elections in 1991.
The Chinese wavered on the ""through train"" idea and the British came up with their own set of arrangements for the 1995 elections.
Since the controversy was triggered off by China's plan to scrap the ""through train"" proposal, would it make concessions on this very issue?
5.
Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council was an honest self-examination of his past commitments regarding the people's livelihood and the work that had been done.
He talked about things he had accomplished and things he had not, laying it all out in an honest, earnest, and realistic way.
One year after arriving in Hong Kong, Patten has certainly commanded much authority with his solid political ideas.
More than that, his skills, language, and operating method as a politician as well as the closeness between him and the public have also set a standard that the leader of the post-1997 special administrative region [SAR] must meet.
During the subsequent question period, Legislative Council members lined up to point out the errors in his report.
Their exchange, complete with questions, answers, charges, and explanations, was democracy in action, live.
Public statements by Chinese officials to this date still contain a lot of empty bureaucratic gobbledygook, devoid of a spirit of seeking truth from facts.
They always lecture the masses on the omnipotence, all-knowingness, invincibility, infallibility, and greatness of government, instead of talking about self-restraint, self-discipline, and self-control.
The real issues are never aired in the open.
Patten demonstrates the modern Western political approach while the Chinese remain wedded to propagating the superiority of ""big, complete, and all-powerful government"" going back thousands of years.
How should the Chinese respond to Patten's new methods indicative of a modern open society?
Should they throw a tantrum and pick a fight with Patten over this?
Or should they take a leaf from Patten's book and try to communicate with the masses using similar methods?
Would the SAR chief after 1997 measure up to Patten's standard?
After the June 4 incident, Deng Xiaoping raised a lot of expectations when he said that he would ""get several practical things done.""
Yet no documents have ever been issued regarding the ""practical issue.""
Have they really materialized?
Patten makes endless allusions to what is good about the Hong Kong system and what is bad about the Chinese system, one obvious example being the way the two governments level with the people.
Even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between Patten and the people of Hong Kong on an equal plane after the governor presented his second annual report (in which the Chinese authorities also played an active part).
6.
For the first time, Patten devoted an entire chapter to Sino-British relations.
He spent a lot of time emphasizing the close ties between China and Hong Kong and the numerous connections between the two, including cooperation in administrative matters and environmental protection.
In the future, bridges of the concrete and steel variety will be built to link the two together.
Even more important will be bridges of the invisible type.
Sino-Hong Kong relations mean China learning from Hong Kong's value system and success story and Hong Kong drawing support form China's strengths.
Patten said, ""When many places in the world identify with Hong Kong's value system and seek to duplicate its success story, would the world become a better place, a more prosperous place?
Or will it become less prosperous?
We all know the answers to these questions.""
(Section 182)
Patten took the initiative to define the relations between China and Hong Kong, giving substance to their contacts as well as clarifying the nature of such relations.
Hong Kong represents progress and as such should be imitated; China represents power and should therefore be a source of support for Hong Kong to tap into.
Together they can take bold strides into the next century.
China has always looked at Hong Kong unilaterally from top to bottom, demanding that it fall in line with China and not the other way round.
The kind of Sino-Hong Kong relations China wants is one in which Hong Kong complies with all China's orders and satisfies every Chinese demand.
Whatever the merits of the case, no matter who represents progress and who represents backwardness, the Chinese want Hong Kong to simply blend itself into the entity known as China.
As for making the Hong Kong system ""living, automatic, and autonomous,"" the relations between China and the special entity of Hong Kong, how the two should be integrated and to what extent, as well as the costs and benefits of such integration... none of that has been considered at length.
Nor do the Chinese allow such consideration; mention differences between the two systems and they cry ""abetting,"" ""sowing discord,"" ""setting one party against another.""
A major incompatibility in Sino-Hong Kong relations is that the sovereign body, namely China, is large but backward, whereas Hong Kong, which has no sovereignty, is small but advanced.
A unilateral emphasis on China's sovereignty would result in integration of a regressive type, meaning that an advanced Hong Kong would have to reach down to accommodate a backward China.
A one-sided emphasis on Hong Kong's non-sovereign status is both impossible and disastrous.
How to define Sino-Hong Kong relations down to the details is a major challenge facing Hong Kong in the future.
The success or failure of this relationship will impact the relations between the mainland and Taiwan and those between the central government on the mainland and the localities (a perennial problem in Chinese politics going back thousands of years).
7.
In his annual report to the Legislative Council, Patten noted subtly and not so subtly that where Hong Kong was free to make up its mind, things had gone well in the past year, but where consultation with China was necessary, nothing seemed to have worked well.
In Section 172, he said.
""...outstanding achievements have been scored on all fronts during the past year...with one lone exception,"" which was Hong Kong's effort to ""further its understanding with China"" and ""replace unproductive speculation with sincere trust.""
(Section 173) Why?
""Not because of a lack of effort, a lack of determination to improve bilateral relations on Hong Kong's part.""
(Section 174) ""The reason is that we still have not been able to convince Chinese officials that Hong Kong citizens' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive but are reasonable and should be met, that they form part of the natural evolution of a society as it matures and becomes more sophisticated.
In a certain sense, political development is also a prerequisite for Hong Kong's remaining a leading player in international trade.
These expectations do not constitute a threat to China now and will not do so in the future.
The fact of the matter is that these expectations can be met within the framework of ""one nation, two systems.""
(Section 175)
Instead of saying the Chinese refused to go along or disagreed, Patten said euphemistically that they (meaning himself and his associates) had failed to convince Chinese officials.
In fact his meaning is very clear.
We all know what the problem is: The failure by the Chinese authorities to see what Patten and others have been able to see.
Cases in point: Pier No. 9, the airport, the harbor, the Sino-British liaison group.
Patten covered all these problems at great length and, in so doing, seemed to have put the ball back in China's court.
Last year the Chinese tried to shoot down Patten's political reform plan in an overbearing way by resorting to economic pressure, ready and willing to destroy all three parties.
What the Chinese wanted to prove was that Patten would not be able to accomplish a thing without China's cooperation, that he would end up with not just one broken leg, but two broken legs.
Basically the Chinese have achieved this goal.
On the other hand, the Chinese were also taking a risk.
The people of Hong Kong might blame the Chinese Government for the delay in solving all those problems that need to be tackled urgently.
What are the Chinese going to do about these feelings?
How to point the accusing finger back at the British?
How to undo the damage the delay has caused Hong Kong and China (particularly Guangdong)?
Who should be held politically accountable?
In the second half of the year, will the Chinese continue to relax their economic austerity drive or will they tighten the belt again?
[passage omitted]","Governor Patten has woven politics into the lives of the people of Hong Kong.
Though he was opposed, the Chinese paid politically for that opposition.
Patten has modified his position and replaced functional groups with statutory bodies and a four group electoral committee and scaled back his demand for an electorate of 2.7 million to one million.

[Text] Lilongwe June 6 SAPA --
Three million people will need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop failure in central and southern Malawi, the United Nations Food Aid Organisation [FAO] said on Monday [6 June].
A recent FAO/World Food Programme crop assessment mission blamed the crop failure on erratic and insufficient rainfall.
This year's cereal production among smallholders is estimated to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted southern Africa.
The mission estimated about 493,000 tons of cereals would have to be imported.
Of the cereal food aid requirement, about 175,000 tons would be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people.
Another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market to stabilise food supply and prices.
""Food scarcity in the markets leads to riots, hoarding and skyrocketing prices.
That happened during the big drought of 1992.
We attach equal importance to keeping the commercial sector well-supplied,"" said WFP Director Phillip Ostenso.
Despite a bumper harvest last year, Malawi has not recovered from the massive 1991/92 drought.
The sharp decline in the production of major crops such as tobacco and cotton due to drought means reduced incomes for many rural households.
Malnutrition rates have always been very high in Malawi, even with good harvests.
Studies suggest more than half of rural pre-school children suffer from chronic malnutrition.
Thus food shortages and high prices can quickly aggravate an already critical situation.
Although landlocked, Malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported through South Africa, Mozambican or, possibly, Tanzanian ports [words indistinct].","Malawi has been added to the list of countries requiring the import of food following crop failure in 1994-95.
Malawi needs the import of food for three million people.
Some of the imported food will be used in the market to stabilize supply and prices.
This would prevent riots, hoarding, and extreme prices, all of which occurred during the 1992 famine.
Malawi has not yet recovered from the 1991-1992 drought.
Malnutrition rates are high, particularly among children.
Malawi is landlocked but it did not have any problems in the distribution of imported food during the previous drought and famine.","[[49, 65], [76, 105], [117, 132], [154, 160], [35, 65], [76, 80], [85, 87], [154, 160], [782, 860], [863, 940], [941, 962], [982, 986], [1135, 1168], [1177, 1192], [1336, 1359], [1367, 1371], [1377, 1391], [1434, 1510], [1601, 1695], [1737, 1752], [1770, 1783]]"

[Text] Comrade Wen Jiabao [member of CPC Central Committee Secretariat] and his party left Changsha for Zhuzhou and Xiangtan yesterday.
He inspected the flooded areas, including Zhuzhou City's Xiawan dike, the Hexi New and High Technology Development Zone, and Linghuayuan and Xiangtan's Yangtianhu, Xingxiadi, Zhoujiangdi, and Shiwandalou, where rescue and relief work was in full swing.
After listening to reports submitted by the two cities on their efforts to fight the flooding and do relief work, he issued important instructions.
Comrade Wen Jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government.
He said: In fighting floods and doing relief work, the broad masses of cadres and people in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of industrial and mining enterprises, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, the 107 National Highway, and cities and thus minimized the losses caused by floods.
This fully shows that, with party leadership and the socialist system, we will be able to overcome all difficulties.
Regarding the work in the next stage, he pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world, stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural production.
He said: After the water recedes, we should firmly grasp the opportunity and repair the damaged dikes and embankments.
As the highest flood season has not yet arrived, we should be prepared at any time to meet new flood peaks head-on rather than slacken our efforts.
We should try every possible means to provide food, clothing, and shelter to flood victims, pay special attention to preventing and curing diseases, and concentrate efforts on the resumption of production and the reconstruction of homes.
He particularly stressed: The current flooding has revealed problems in the construction of water conservancy facilities and urban flood control.
In the past, inadequate consideration has been given to urban flood control and the coordination of urban and rural flood control.
In the next step, we should earnestly draw a lesson from this negative experience.
Governor Chen Bangzhu urged the party committees and governments of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan to convey Comrade Wen Jiabao's regards and instructions on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council for the broad masses of cadres and people to the party committees and governments at all levels as soon as possible, earnestly implement them, and effectively carry out the work of fighting floods, doing relief work, and helping oneself by engaging in production.","Comrade Wen Jiabao and his party left Changsha yesterday to inspect the flooded areas of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan.

[Text] Donetsk Oblast [no date as received] -- As UNIAN reported, miners at the ""Ordzhonikidzevuhillya"" coal production association and the ""Yenakiyevo"" and ""Poltava"" pits went on strike in Yenakiyevo on 27 June, demanding payment of wage arrears.
The strike continued at these mines on 28 June.
Some of the miners at the Karl Marx, ""Chernovonyy Zhovten,"" ""Chervonyy Profinter,"" and ""Yunkom"" pits joined the strike.
A total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 workers are on strike.
A rally consisting of 350 miners was held on 28 June near the town council building where demands were made to pay the wages and dismiss the director general of the ""Ordzhonikidzevuhillya"" production association.
A strike committee consisting of 12 persons was elected (one of the members is a former Komsomol leader and former USSR people's deputy Viktor Honcharov) and it was decided to continue the strike until the demands that had been raised have been completely fulfilled.
On 28 June, 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the ""PivdennoDonbass"" mine of the ""Donetskvuhillya"" production association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the same reasons -- delay in paying wages.
After a meeting with the mine's director, who promised to pay the arrears, the miners on the third shift returned to work.
On 27 June, all miners on the fourth shift at the ""Karbomid"" and ""Pervomaysk"" mines in Pervomaysk, Lugansk oblast, refused to start work (142 and 157 miners respectively).
In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections.
According to some reports, among the leaders of the striking pits there are members of the Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Bloc of Reforms.
As Kostyantyn Fesenko, chairman of the coal industry workers trade union, informed a UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, in a telephone conversation on 29 June, gave assurances that the money for the miners' wages as well as subsidies for the following month would be found and forwarded in the next few days.","Ukrainian coal miners at the coal production association and at three pits, went on strike demanding payment of wage arrears.

"How can 6,000 civil servants, mostly based in Washington, best promote development in the Third World?
That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis Preston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takes over as president of the World Bank this September.
As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no shortage of advice.
The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.
The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.
Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.
Mr Preston may relax on one count.
Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems: Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day.
More than 110m Third World children lack access even to primary education.
Horrific inequality abounds.
In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10 per cent is 20 years less than for the richest 10 per cent.
What kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr Barber Conable?
Most reports are mixed.
'It is not an impressive bureaucracy,' says Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.
'
The morale of staff is lousy,' says Mr Charles Flickner, a senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the bank.
Mr Conable, a former Republican congressman, arrived at the bank in 1986 knowing little about either banking or development.
Although now well-liked (partly for championing causes such as women's rights in the Third World), many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start involving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank.
Mr Percy Mistry, a scholar at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, and former senior adviser at the bank, says it suffered from 'presidential failure' during the 1980s.
Mr Robert McNamara, a forceful chief executive in the 1970s, built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership from the top.
But neither Mr Conable nor his predecessor, Mr A W 'Tom' Clausen, a commercial banker, could fill his shoes.
For a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed - vice-presidents:
Mr Ernest Stern (who nearly left last year to join the EBRD) and Mr Moeen Qureshi.
Mr Preston's first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience.
His third, one might add, will be quickly to establish his independence from the US Treasury which always browbeats a newcomer.
What kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit?
In spite of recent progress in a few countries, such as Mexico, the past decade has been one of relative failure.
Many Third World countries have gone backwards.
Real per capita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, and mildly in Latin America.
The biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, in 1989, as a 'final solution' to the debt crisis.
Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden of developing countries' private debts on condition that they implement market-oriented economic reforms. '
The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt.
Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the recent forgiveness of about half of Poland's official debt will not set a precedent for other debtors.
Mr Williamson laughs.
'In the long run it will be impossible to isolate Poland,' he says.
'It is not so much more deserving than other countries.'
But why was a Brady-type solution not launched much earlier?
For most of the 1980s, the First World doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness.
The result of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some Dollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980.
'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,' concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council in Washington.
(The IMF was equally short-sighted.)
As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development.
The main innovation of the 1980s was a switch from project lending to 'structural adjustment' lending.
Making finance conditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economic performance of developing countries.
But studies indicate the results have been fairly unimpressive.
This is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank's policies were sometimes misguided.
Professor John Toye, director of the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, recently completed an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes.
He concludes (as do internal bank analyses) that policy-based lending has 'achieved something, particularly in relation to the external account, but not nearly as much as the bank and donor community hoped'.
On average programmes have reduced balance of payments gaps, had a negligible impact on Gross National Product and led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP.

(Investment to GNP ratios have fallen markedly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.)
He says the bank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of adjustment by increasing investment.
How can the bank do better in the 1990s?
One problem is that it has lost leverage over many Third World governments.
The maturing of bank programmes and the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries.
According to Mr Lawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the next five years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing world compared with Dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s.
For the large number of countries that do not qualify for concessional loans, the net flow will be negative.
Some analysts, including US Treasury officials, believe lacklustre performance in much of the Third World reflects the inefficiency (and sometimes corruption) of governments.
The EBRD's constitution requires borrowers to be 'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics'.
It also says 60 per cent of EBRD resources must be devoted to the commercial sector - private businesses and state concerns in the process of privatisation.
The World Bank operates under very different rules: its charter requires it to be non-political and only its small affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), can make direct loans to private businesses.
Should the bank's charter be amended?
Direct parallels between the bank and the EBRD are dubious.
The EBRD is ministering to a region that has historical ties with western Europe and that has declared its commitment to democracy and free markets.
Such values are alien in many developing countries, but that does not imply they should be denied the means for economic development.
If strict political conditionality had been imposed in the past, the bank could not have lent to a development star such as South Korea.
Most analysts, however, say the bank should tighten up a little.
Mr Flickner of the Senate Budget Committee says the issue is not whether to insist on Westminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that 'loans will benefit the majority of the people'.
Bank officials say greater attention will be paid to issues such as the rule of law and transparency of decision-taking.
Should a significant chunk of the bank's loans be made direct to the private sector?
Mr Conable, to his credit, is resisting the US Treasury's pressure.
He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a 'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developing countries.
In reality, much of the most badly-needed investment is in spheres such as infrastructure, health care and education where governments play a dominant role even in industrialised countries.
Indeed, one conclusion of Prof Toye's analysis is that policy-based loans would have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expand the role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promote economic liberalisation.
Sir William Ryrie, the head of the IFC, says the objective of a large volume of public lending to the private sector is wrong-headed.
'
What we are trying to do is facilitate the flow of private-sector funds into sound investments.'
Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector are surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs; but if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank's judgment of market risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west?
There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development.
During the 1980s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums.
It wanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently fashionable in the industrialised world.
But the notion that economic liberalisation alone is sufficient is increasingly questioned.
The bank's own research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly and to improve fundamentals, such as education, nutrition and health care.
'Liberalisation matters,' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for International Economics, 'but education is more important.'
He argues that the best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to put resources into education and primary health care.
Mr Feinberg at the Overseas Development Council broadly agrees: the bank has got to find a way of 'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development'.

Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.

Source: World Bank -----------------------------------------------------------------------","When Lewis Preston takes over as president of the World Bank this September, he will have to find a way to best promote development in the Third World.
The bank has not had an effective president since the 1980s when Robert McNamara headed the institution.
Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world where 1 billion people live on less than one dollar a day.
In the past decade Third World countries have gone backwards.
Real per capita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, and mildly in Latin America.","[[141, 154], [214, 270], [58, 101], [2357, 2400], [2281, 2289], [2299, 2334], [3251, 3266], [3301, 3348], [3349, 3472], [1149, 1263]]"
"How can 6,000 civil servants, mostly based in Washington, best promote development in the Third World?
That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis Preston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takes over as president of the World Bank this September.
As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no shortage of advice.
The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.
The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.
Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.
Mr Preston may relax on one count.
Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems: Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day.
More than 110m Third World children lack access even to primary education.
Horrific inequality abounds.
In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10 per cent is 20 years less than for the richest 10 per cent.
What kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr Barber Conable?
Most reports are mixed.
'It is not an impressive bureaucracy,' says Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.
'
The morale of staff is lousy,' says Mr Charles Flickner, a senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the bank.
Mr Conable, a former Republican congressman, arrived at the bank in 1986 knowing little about either banking or development.
Although now well-liked (partly for championing causes such as women's rights in the Third World), many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start involving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank.
Mr Percy Mistry, a scholar at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, and former senior adviser at the bank, says it suffered from 'presidential failure' during the 1980s.
Mr Robert McNamara, a forceful chief executive in the 1970s, built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership from the top.
But neither Mr Conable nor his predecessor, Mr A W 'Tom' Clausen, a commercial banker, could fill his shoes.
For a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed - vice-presidents:
Mr Ernest Stern (who nearly left last year to join the EBRD) and Mr Moeen Qureshi.
Mr Preston's first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience.
His third, one might add, will be quickly to establish his independence from the US Treasury which always browbeats a newcomer.
What kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit?
In spite of recent progress in a few countries, such as Mexico, the past decade has been one of relative failure.
Many Third World countries have gone backwards.
Real per capita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, and mildly in Latin America.
The biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, in 1989, as a 'final solution' to the debt crisis.
Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden of developing countries' private debts on condition that they implement market-oriented economic reforms. '
The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt.
Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the recent forgiveness of about half of Poland's official debt will not set a precedent for other debtors.
Mr Williamson laughs.
'In the long run it will be impossible to isolate Poland,' he says.
'It is not so much more deserving than other countries.'
But why was a Brady-type solution not launched much earlier?
For most of the 1980s, the First World doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness.
The result of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some Dollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980.
'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,' concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council in Washington.
(The IMF was equally short-sighted.)
As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development.
The main innovation of the 1980s was a switch from project lending to 'structural adjustment' lending.
Making finance conditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economic performance of developing countries.
But studies indicate the results have been fairly unimpressive.
This is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank's policies were sometimes misguided.
Professor John Toye, director of the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, recently completed an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes.
He concludes (as do internal bank analyses) that policy-based lending has 'achieved something, particularly in relation to the external account, but not nearly as much as the bank and donor community hoped'.

"NEGOTIATIONS FOR a new contract between Botswana, the world's most important diamond producer in value terms, and De Beers, the South African group which controls 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking much longer than expected.
The previous three-year contract ended on December 31.
Some Botswana politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the South African group's international cartel.
This would give Botswana its own 'market window' to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market.
De Beers is resisting any change.
Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the group's Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSO's ability to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised.
He said: 'Because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell exclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.'
However, IDC (Holdings), a London-based group which claims to be the most experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO, suggests the CSO's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual argument with little substance in fact.'
In presentations to Botswana's Minerals Policy Committee and members of parliament, IDC has been arguing that, not only was it commercially essential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output, but that the country had a political responsibility to do so.
'Data accumulated independently of the CSO would put Botswana in a position to have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' IDC pointed out.
'On a political level this would enable the government to answer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when questioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country's mineral assets.'
If Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth about USDollars 100m, independently of the CSO - which sells about Dollars 4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to market stability, IDC said.
It claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of De Beers' diamond profits in 1989 came from Botswana.
'
This profit is disproportionate to the sale of diamonds by Debswana (De Beers' subsidiary in Botswana) to the CSO as a percentage of the CSO's total sales profits,' IDC says.
'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the CSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale of its diamonds.'
Other substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and Australia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have access to independent market information.
IDC does have a vested interest.
It already markets diamonds for producers in Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering to do some marketing for Botswana.
It acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO's efforts to keep the diamond market stable.
But 'the fact that the CSO forms part of an aggressive, profit-motivated public company with a primary responsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view.'
De Beers says Botswana diamonds do not contribute half its diamond account profits - but it will not divulge the true figure.
It suggests IDC's arguments are flawed because they are based on an assumption that Botswana needs more market information.
However, in common with other producers selling diamonds to the CSO, Botswana has appointed independent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the prices paid.
According to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market conditions and the prices received for Botswana stones.
Mr Geoffrey Leggett at IDC suggests, however, the valuer only ensures that the assortment of diamonds from Botswana conforms to an agreed sample and that the agreed contract price is paid.
'
He is not a trader, he does not know what the stones are worth in the market.'
De Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the country is still selling its diamonds through the CSO.
It is not the first time that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline.
The Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De Beers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's understanding of the market.
There has been a special relationship between the CSO and Botswana since 1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers in exchange for an estimated USDollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the South African group.
Analysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case.
De Beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough diamond output, markets stones from Angola, Australia, Namibia, Tanzania, Zaire and the Soviet Union, as well as South Africa and Botswana.
Prices of rough diamonds, with few exceptions, have moved upwards every year since the 1930s depression.
But now De Beers is steering the world's most successful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the recession in the US (the biggest single market for diamonds), sogginess in Japan (the second-largest), and the Gulf war.
To maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great expense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market.
Its promotional budget has been lifted by 20 per cent to more than Dollars 1m a week - Dollars 53m for the year.
In addition, Botswana this year faces its first budgetary deficit since 1982 and, according to De Beers' calculations, one of its diamond mines - Orapa -needs investment of USDollars 600m. The CSO has also notched up some recent coups: bringing a big part of the Soviet Union's and Angola's rough diamond output back into the cartel - or what it calls its 'single channel marketing' - arrangements.
However, the CSO is also currently involved in contract negotiations with Argyle Diamonds, the western Australian company which is the biggest individual diamond producer in volume (but only sixth in value) terms.
Argyle, too, wants to stay with the CSO when its contract ends on May 1 - but on more favourable terms.
A delegation from Botswana is to meet CSO representatives in London at the end of this month for another attempt to break the deadlock.
The industry is betting that Botswana will give way, perhaps in return for De Beers helping to finance the Orapa mine investment.
However, the 'market window' idea is unlikely to be dropped and will almost certainly be raised again when the next contract negotiations start.","Botswana is the world's most important producer of valuable diamonds.
De Beers has had a special relationship with Botswana since 1987 when Botswana sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers for 250 million dollars and a 5.27 percent share in the company.
The contract between Botswana and De Beers expired on December 31, 1990.
A new contract is being negotiated, and Botswana wants to sell some of its output independently.
De Beers rejects that.

"TEAMS OF US and inter-national experts are being sent to southern Africa to assess the impact on food supplies of what in some areas is the worst drought of the century.
Officials said millions of people will be affected, AP reports from Washington.
Among the hardest hit of the 10 drought-stricken countries are Zimbabwe and South Africa, traditional food exporters which this year will have to import substantial quantities of grain.
As the drought persists, estimates of the grain harvest throughout the region have been falling precipitously.
The deteriorating situation in southern Africa adds a new dimension to the continent's overall food crisis.
The north-east is the most deprived area in Africa, encompassing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti.
The lives of 15m people are thought to be at risk.
Officials in Zimbabwe said last week 60,000 cattle died from starvation during February alone and thousands more will die unless heavy rains come soon.
The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation warned late last month that the drought could lead to widespread famine.
About 98m people live in the affected regions in southern Africa.

"A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority.
The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the Moldovan authorities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr.
At least nine people have been killed in clashes over the past week.
As in the more severe conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the underlying tensions are growing and neither side believes it is losing.
In other respects, however, the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former Soviet Union is now faced.
The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been a source of tension between Azeris and Armenians for centuries.
Moldova (formerly Moldavia) was finally taken under full Soviet control in 1944.
The Soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with Romania - calling Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and constructing a separate history for the Moldovan people.
Industry was largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and Ukrainians.
Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of the population, with Moldovans accounting for 64 per cent.
The little republic (4.5m people) was slow to respond to the stirrings of reform.
When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present nationalist government, headed by President Mircea Snegur, the former secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee.
From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile, reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov.
During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the Trans Dnestr authorities welcomed it, siding with the Soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule.
Thereafter, the two sides have gathered military forces.
The Trans Dnestr side has been augmented by Cossacks from nearby areas returning to their traditional role as defenders of Russia's borders.
The daily Izvestia reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenaries for the Russians (they are paid from Rbs2,000 to Rbs5,000 a week by the Trans Dnestr authorities).","The large majority of the authorities in Moldavia are ethnic Romanians.
The cease-fire between them and the Russian-speaking minority was short-lived.

"THE effects of widespread drought on grain production in South Africa could negate the expected recovery in economic growth in the second half of the year, Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the country's agriculture minister, said yesterday.
Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, had been expecting the recession-hit economy to expand by 1.5 per cent this year.
However, Mr van Niekerk said: ' As a result of agriculture's low production in summer rainfall areas, there is a great possibility the expected growth rate could be practically obliterated in the second half of 1992.'
His predictions followed warnings on Wednesday that drought in southern Africa could cause famine in much of the region.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on the average.
It said Zimbabwe and South Africa, which normally offset shortages in the area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food.
Other than these two countries, Mozambique and Zambia were likely to be most seriously affected.
The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for southern Africa this year.
Total food imports for the region could be as high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year.
Logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the FAO said, with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail wagons.
It said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention was focused on emergencies in the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Iraq and the Horn of Africa.","South Africa's drought could adversely affect grain production and cancel out the expected recovery in economic growth, according to the country's agricultural minister.
He predicted earlier that hot and dry conditions in southern Africa could cause widespread famine.

"MADE IN AMERICA:
MY STORY By Sam Walton Doubleday, Dollars 22.50.
269 pages Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out.
The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright.
In a country where business practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve.
A vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.
Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who died of cancer in April, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most.
When, in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, the paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied by chicken farmers, where Walton made his home.
What they found was a happily married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at the local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two hub-caps.
Folksy was an understatement.
Since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies, the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops -have been subject to critical scrutiny.
So, to an extent, have the less wholesome adventures of the four Walton children.
But no one has ever been able to make Sam himself look bad.
The worst that has been said is that he was rather dull.
Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions.
Readers will either find his autobiography lashed with 'good ol' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if charming, anecdotes.
Or they will find it dreary and downbeat.
Walton makes no excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one stage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate . . . .'
A few snippets are more revealing about the character.
There cannot be many billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.
Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his business is inescapable.
In one of many contributions from friends and family, Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam one Saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysing his rival's stock.
And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when the couple was on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband was off on a similar scouting mission.
But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best.
Explaining the annual contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to promote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow buckets for carrying bait.
Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice. '
So I would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .
put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow bucket.
I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit.
It drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'
But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the truth.
Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called Moon Pies.
For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.
Occasionally, it just grates.
'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for about about Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bank with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits.
But it helped me learn a lot about financing things.'
Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?
The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when Walton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written this book'.
Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars 4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it.
But these are unlikely to be circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis.
At the end of the day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.","Sam Walton died in April 1992.
Shortly before his death he wrote about his life in a book entitled, ""Made in America: My Story"".
It is the story of a happily married and well-liked man who lived frugally in an obscure corner of Arkansas.
Readers may find the book boring and dreary.
It is full of common sense, and charming and humorous anecdotes.
It does not directly address his company's non-union policies, and the impact of his 40 billion dollar giant on the mom-and-pop stores in the small towns where he located his stores.","[[432, 442], [503, 507], [518, 526], [680, 710], [748, 774], [796, 841], [907, 958], [1554, 1594], [1454, 1510], [1533, 1552], [1039, 1140], [0, 39]]"

"THERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew, unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana, may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of President George Bush.
After a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster, both the president and his administration seem finally to be getting assistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that have been destroyed.
In the process, Mr Bush has been able to call on the power of incumbency, the one asset denied his presidential rival, Mr Bill Clinton, who is to visit Florida today.
This was brought home graphically by the president's announcement that Homestead Air Force base in Florida - a major local employer virtually destroyed by Andrew - would be rebuilt.
His poignant and brief address to the nation on Tuesday night, committing the government to pay the emergency relief costs and calling on Americans to contribute to the American Red Cross, also struck the right sort of note.
It was only his tenth such televised speech from the Oval Office, itself a testimony to the gravity of the situation.
As if to underline the political benefit to the president, a Harris poll conducted from August 26 to September 1 yesterday showed Mr Bush with 45 per cent support - behind Mr Clinton by just five points - reflecting a closer race than other recent surveys.
With Mr Bush constantly in the headlines, Mr Clinton has been left on the sidelines, able to do little more than offer sympathy and sotto voce criticism of the president's initial stumbling.
First responses were certainly found wanting, specifically in the performance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) set up by President Carter in 1979 to handle disasters such as Andrew.
FEMA has, under the Republicans, become the ultimate patronage backwater, with, according to one congressional study, ten times as many political appointees as the typical arm of government.
Its current head, Mr Wallace Stickney, is a New Hampshire political associate of Mr John Sununu, the former state governor and White House chief of staff.
Contrary to its brief, but confirming a prescient recent report by a House committee that Mr Stickney was 'uninterested in substantive programmes', FEMA was caught completely unprepared by Andrew, resulting in unseemly disputes between state and federal authorities over who did what in bringing relief.
However, the arrival in Florida of the military and the assignment of special responsibilities to Mr Andrew Card, the young and telegenic transportation secretary, is making a difference.
Also increasingly evident is the hand of Mr James Baker, now ensconced at the White House.
It was Mr Baker who reshuffled the president's campaign schedule to make room for visits to the devastated areas and who pushed for a bigger role for the previously obscure Mr Card.
It is also Mr Baker who is making the most of presidential powers to dispense largesse.
Yesterday, Mr Bush flew to South Dakota to tell farmers of an expansion of the subsidised grains exports programme and then to the General Dynamics factory in Texas to announce an F-16 fighter sale to Taiwan.
Both are, of course, intensely political actions.
Both involve federal subsidies, as does relief for Andrew, that run counter to Mr Bush's commitment to reduce the budget deficit.
But both may be presented by a president as being in the national interest because they guarantee employment, which is what the election is largely about.
US insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana, the American Insurance Services Group said yesterday, Nikki Tait reports.
This takes the insurance bill from the storm to around Dollars 8bn, making it the costliest disaster to hit the US.","Hurricane Andrew, the costliest disaster to hit the US, has helped the re- election campaign of President Bush.

Both involve federal subsidies, as does relief for Andrew, that run counter to Mr Bush's commitment to reduce the budget deficit.
But both may be presented by a president as being in the national interest because they guarantee employment, which is what the election is largely about.
US insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana, the American Insurance Services Group said yesterday, Nikki Tait reports.
This takes the insurance bill from the storm to around Dollars 8bn, making it the costliest disaster to hit the US.","Despite an initial faltering and inadequate response to the Hurricane Andrew devastation, the Administration now appears to have its act together and President Bush's re-election campaign may, in the end, not be harmed.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, saddled with political appointees was totally unprepared for the disaster, but is now being ""shaped-up"".
The Administration is also improving its standing through the dispensing of largess, such as a promise to rebuild Homestead Air Base, an important job source for Floridians.
US insurers expect to pay around $500M in claims for Andrew's damage in Louisiana, taking the total insurance bill to $8B.","[[29, 45], [210, 277], [302, 320], [60, 62], [124, 202], [1661, 1700], [1779, 1787], [1915, 1935], [2273, 2320], [2896, 2909], [2914, 2916], [2959, 2976], [3522, 3643], [3719, 3748], [3764, 3785], [660, 738], [771, 787]]"
"HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans.
The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country.
Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.
In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia.
Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans.
Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land.
By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph.
Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas.
The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut.
The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.
More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said.
In north Miami, damage is minimal.
Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded.
Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000.
US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.
Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area.
Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn.
Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water.
Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn.
Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.","Hurricane Andrew made landfall late Tuesday night some 60 miles southwest of New Orleans smashing its way through largely rural Cajun country.
The hurricane landed with winds of about 120 mph, causing severe damage in small coastal centers, but sparing New Orleans.

"In the closing stages of the election campaign President George Bush is trying to win votes by convincing the public that Mr Bill Clinton has made a hash of governing Arkansas.
The state ranks at or near bottom on almost every social and economic criteria, says Mr Bush. '
He would do for the United States what he's done to Arkansas.
We do not want to be the lowest of the low.'
Arkansas is still one of the poorest states in the US.
It ranks 47th in terms of income, ahead of only Mississippi, Utah and West Virginia.
Per capita incomes are three-quarters of the national average, roughly the same ratio as in 1979 when Mr Clinton was first elected governor.
But while the scale of Mr Clinton's achievement in Arkansas is disputed, the implication that he has done nothing right in 12 years is unwarranted.
Mr Clinton's first gubernatorial term was a failure.
The youthful governor, then in his early 30s, charged in 'like a knight on a white horse to set the world straight' recalls Ms Diane Blair, a campaign official and old friend.
'
He tried to do too much, too soon and stepped on just about every economic toe in Arkansas.'
Defeat in 1980 by a Republican was a seminal event in Mr Clinton's life.
He returned to the governor's mansion in 1983 a wiser politician, committed to consensus, rather than controversy, and convinced that he could make progress only on one or two fronts at a time.
The priorities he chose were economic development and educational reform.
The statistics point to significant achievements in both fields.
Mr Clinton has also been innovative in welfare reform, pioneering forms of 'work-fare' that make benefits conditional on acceptance of jobs or skill training.
But his record since 1983 can be criticised in many other respects.
For example, he has relied too heavily on an unfair tax system, paid too little attention to the environment, failed to pass civil rights legislation, and done less than some other states to reform a poorly functioning health-care system.
In promoting industrial development Mr Clinton has struck a balance between free enterprise and government intervention.
'
I know Bill well enough to know he's fully committed to the free market,' says Mr Warren Stephens, president of Stephens Inc, a financial services group based in Little Rock.
Mr Stephens is backing Mr Clinton in the presidential race, having always previously favoured Republicans.
But while welcoming competition, Mr Clinton believes government must create an environment conducive to growth.
His 'hands on' approach was tested in 1985 when International Paper threatened to close down its plants in Pine Bluff and Camden, mill towns in southern Arkansas.
'Clinton went nuts,' says Mr John Brummett, political editor of the Arkansas Times.
After hectic negotiations, he persuaded the company to expand its operations in Arkansas, but only after creating an unusually generous investment tax credit worth seven cents on the dollar.
Mr Dave Harrington, the head of Arkansas's Industrial Development Commission, says the state's goal is to forge a partnership between the private and public sectors.
'We're in trouble in this country because many people believe government and business should be separated.
Elsewhere there is a unity of purpose, a complementarity.
Mr Clinton has brought a lot of that to Arkansas.'
The commission has targetted high-tech sectors, such as aerospace, in its bid to strengthen Arkansas's manufacturing base.
Along with development agencies in other states it also energetically promotes inward investment, offering both tax incentives and special support services.
'We guarantee to a company that we will tailor-train its workforce,' says Mr Harrington.
'We do whatever it takes, including, for example, sending workers to Germany for training.'
The Arkansas economy has revived during the Clinton years, creating jobs faster than the nation, especially in the past three years.
Manufacturing employment has grown about 12 per cent since 1980 compared with a 9 per cent contraction nationally, and accounts for about 20 per cent of employment against 15 per cent nationally.
Some 109 foreign companies, including big names such as British Aerospace and Dassault, the French aerospace group, have sizeable investments in the state, three times as many as in 1979.
How much of this progress reflects active industrial policies is uncertain.
Companies have also been attracted by Arkansas's low wages, weak unions and central location.
During the Bush years, the state may have looked artificially strong because other regions experienced a hangover after the speculative excesses of the 1980s.
In the longer-term, Arkansas hopes that educational reforms will pay economic dividends.
In the late 1970s Arkansas schools were widely regarded as among the nation's worst.
On some measures they still lag badly: Arkansas ranks 25th out of 28 states using the American College Test, a popular college admission exam.
This is a few places worse than in 1979.
Mr Burton Elliott, Arkansas's director of education, says the lack of improvement reflects a rise from 38 per cent to 51 per cent in the proportion of students attending college; many of the weaker pupils tested today would have been drop-outs a decade ago.
But he readily concedes the benefits of many reforms are yet to be realised.
'School improvement is a process, not an event; it takes time.'
Mr Clinton's main schools legislation was passed in 1983, following a year of state-wide consultations led by his wife, Hillary.
The measures included an increase in teachers' salaries, then the lowest in the US; tougher course requirements (many schools in rural areas had not previously offered advanced courses in maths, science or languages); a reduction in average class sizes; and regular testing of pupils to check progress.
In the past two years, Mr Clinton has built on this foundation with a 'second wave' of reforms.
He has encouraged more competition within the public sector by allowing students a free choice of schools and by making school districts publish 'report cards' measuring their relative performance.
Teachers' salaries have again been increased, rising by 14 per cent in the past year. .
Mr Mahlon Martin, head of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation in Little Rock, says Mr Clinton's real achievement has been to change attitudes.
A state that previously paid little attention to schooling has been persuaded that 'the long-term solution to economic problems lies in a commitment to education'.
In a poor region, money speaks louder than words.
Mr Clinton has repeatedly persuaded a sceptical legislature to finance educational reforms by big increases in sales taxes.
He has done so partly by taking on the teachers' unions.
The 1 cent sales tax to finance the 1983 reforms was agreed only after Mr Clinton insisted on competence tests for teachers.
Some 1,400 teachers lost their jobs, causing a rupture in relations between union leaders and Mr Clinton.
While grudgingly acknowledging some achievements, Mr Clinton's critics in Arkansas find plenty to complain about. '
He has been a tax-and-spend governor who believes in intervention,' says Mr Charles Venus, a Little Rock economic consultant with a free market bent.
'
Within six months or a year' of entering the White House, a President Clinton would be pressing for a national value-added tax to pay for social reforms, he warns.
The figures, however, hardly suggest that Mr Clinton has created a Leviathan in Arkansas: the ratio of state and local taxes to personal incomes is still the fifth-lowest in the nation.
Ms Meredith Oakley, a political columnist for the conservative Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, is even more scathing.
'I'd rate him only average as a chief executive.
It's not his vision that I have problems with, it's his ability to translate it into something worthwhile.
Millions of Americans are going to be disappointed.'
Mr Brummett of the Arkansas Times, while better disposed towards Mr Clinton, echoes her theme.
'
The bottom line is that he could have got a lot more done if he had pushed harder.
He has a tendency to compromise quickly.
He is obsessed with trying to please people.'
Critics cite two instances where Mr Clinton has fallen short.
The governor has repeatedly relied on increases in sales taxes which are 'regressive' - in the sense that they inevitably absorb a larger proportion of the incomes of the poor than the rich.
The excuse was that this was unavoidable because a three-quarters majority of the legislature is needed to pass an increase in income taxes.
Mr Brummett and others, however, say Mr Clinton had the authority to insist on a fairer solution; he could at least have won exemptions for commodities such as food.
The environment is a second example.
'
He went for jobs, jobs, jobs when he could have been truer to his instincts,' says one critic.
Mr Clinton has been widely attacked for standing back while big companies, such as poultry producers, badly polluted Arkansas's rivers.
No governor who has served as long as Mr Clinton can avoid mistakes or expect to be free of controversy.
But what general conclusions for a Clinton presidency can be drawn from his Arkansas record?
His belief in education as a vehicle for economic and social advance is hard to question.
If elected, he would be certain to use the power of the presidency to promote this cause.
Perhaps more surprising, he has just as solid a record in promoting business; he differs with many conservatives only in instinctively rejecting a laissez-faire approach.
Rightly or wrongly, he is likely to regard his Arkansas record as evidence that active industrial policies can indeed 'grow manufacturing jobs'.
The biggest doubt lies over his toughness: will he have the determination to overcome the formidable interest group pressure blocking reform in Washington?
One reason for optimism is Mr Clinton's remarkable ability to bridge social and economic gaps: it is striking, for example, that he wins 90 per cent of the vote in the poorest regions of Arkansas while also attracting enthusiastic support from the state's elite business leaders.
If Mr Clinton wins this election, the White House will be occupied by a pragmatic moderate with a talent for building diverse coalitions.
After the ideological infighting of the past decade this could prove a recipe for constructive change.","Republican George Bush claims Clinton has governed poorly in Arkansas.

"MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said: 'I cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward.'
He also indicated that they achieved little progress in settling the impasse over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project.
Mr Patten said that they had agreed the best forum for settlement was the Airport Committee of the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group - a place where consensus has been stalled for months.
This is Mr Patten's first visit to China as governor of Hong Kong.
He leaves for the colony tomorrow after discussions today with Chinese trade officials.
It emerged last night that Li Peng, China's prime minister, had refused to see him.
Instead he will meet Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister.
On October 7, Mr Patten presented plans for the conduct of the colony's 1994 local and 1995 legislative elections which provide for much greater democracy than has previously been the case in Hong Kong.
In considering alternatives to these plans, the governor said he was guided by three principles.
They should be 'fair', 'open and honest', and 'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong', he said.
Mr Patten said that he was prepared to meet Lu 'at any time and in any place' to reach agreement but had reminded the Chinese they had only until the end of the year.
He said the legislative timetable demanded that bills be put before the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's unicameral legislature, early in the new year to give effect to the planned changes for the 1994 and 1995 elections.
Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval.
He went out of his way, however, to praise Lu - the man who holds day-to-day responsibility for ensuring a smooth transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
He lauded the manner in which Lu put forward China's position but was less than pleased with what he had to say.
Mr Patten would give only few details of Lu's response to his proposals.
He said that Lu pointed out the existence of the Basic Law - the Beijing-drafted constitution for Hong Kong post-1997.
(This has become Chinese code for 'no change'.)
'I am bound to say I don't think this answers some of the problems I have to disentangle before the end of this year,' the governor said.
His visit has been preceded by a barrage of criticism of himself and his proposals, in the pro-Beijing Hong Kong press, not seen since the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Mr Patten's defeat in the British parliamentary election earlier this year has been used to suggest he is a failed politician.","Hong Kong Governor Patten pressed China to accept his proposals for the Colony's political development or make alternatives.

"THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people.
It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good.
With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction.
What piffle.
Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats.
Fifteen months too late, the voters of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury.
In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public.
In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness.
But in private they relax.
Their syntax disappears.
Their words become nonsensical.
They swear and joke and shout.
It really is a spectacle.
To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith.
Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know that.
In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching.
To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler.
No one could have eavesdropped.
Their responses were true to form.
But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged . . .
Four-letter expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts) pages.'
I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle.
First, I tackled Major.
I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week?
They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements.
They did not pull their punches.
I bet you went chalk-white. '
So why not walk the plank, John?
You are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century.
Why invite more punishment?
Unfairly or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone the cock-ups.'
'Are you sure?'
the prime minister replied.
'I mean . . .
how did it come about, Michael . . .
like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . .
.
let me put it to you - the economy, of course . . .
I mean, wimpy guy like me.
But I'm not giving in like that, like . . .'
On and on it went.
Then I rang John Smith.
I told him I had been impressed with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever gets elected), including a referendum on proportional representation.
I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John.
Many people will have agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the elimination of opposition'.
But some of your critics still accuse you, John, of laziness and ineffectualness.
What do you say to that?""Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader. '

But I couldn't raise the energy.","John Major's public image as a wimp may have changed following a candid interview with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor.
Major used a variety of epitaphs to describe certain colleagues who are not his favorites.
It is a change that comes too late.

In reality, the language of all politicians, including Major, changes when they speak in private.
Gone are the crafted sentences as a certain saltiness creeps in and the politicians swear and joke.","[[20, 30], [45, 51], [228, 285], [459, 477], [493, 520], [296, 319], [349, 413], [459, 472], [498, 520], [535, 552], [793, 801], [571, 580], [609, 611], [616, 640], [648, 671], [682, 734], [742, 776], [887, 935], [940, 986], [1146, 1169], [1171, 1201], [1203, 1232], [899, 914], [932, 935], [940, 944], [956, 961], [976, 986], [1017, 1068], [1123, 1133], [1203, 1222]]"
"THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people.
It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good.
With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction.
What piffle.
Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats.
Fifteen months too late, the voters of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury.
In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public.
In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness.
But in private they relax.
Their syntax disappears.
Their words become nonsensical.
They swear and joke and shout.
It really is a spectacle.
To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith.
Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know that.
In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching.
To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler.
No one could have eavesdropped.
Their responses were true to form.
But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged . . .
Four-letter expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts) pages.'
I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle.
First, I tackled Major.
I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week?
They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements.
They did not pull their punches.
I bet you went chalk-white. '
So why not walk the plank, John?
You are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century.
Why invite more punishment?
Unfairly or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone the cock-ups.'
'Are you sure?'
the prime minister replied.
'I mean . . .
how did it come about, Michael . . .
like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . .
.
let me put it to you - the economy, of course . . .
I mean, wimpy guy like me.
But I'm not giving in like that, like . . .'
On and on it went.
Then I rang John Smith.
I told him I had been impressed with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever gets elected), including a referendum on proportional representation.
I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John.
Many people will have agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the elimination of opposition'.
But some of your critics still accuse you, John, of laziness and ineffectualness.
What do you say to that?""Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader. '
Gie me o'wit an' sense a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent.
Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, a clever, sturdy fellow, but then he was sae fley'd by his showther gae a keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle.
Likewise with political and constitutional reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]' After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch.
But I couldn't raise the energy.","Some believe that the recording of John Major's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used salty language will improve Major's image as a wimp.
Not so.
Major is gone, especially after the Christchurch by-election where a Conservative majority in last year's general election was transformed to a liberal Democrats majority of 16,427.
Actually, all politicians are far more candid when speaking privately.
To demonstrate, I spoke yesterday with both Major and John Smith, Labor Party leader.
Using a scrambler, to guarantee privacy, I provoked some frank discussion.
The rambling responses of both were liberally sprinkled with expletives.","[[158, 261], [287, 354], [459, 520], [522, 533], [535, 582], [612, 640], [642, 674], [685, 776], [887, 914], [932, 986], [887, 986], [1260, 1377], [1478, 1546], [1548, 1600], [1634, 1704]]"
"GUERRILLA tactics by Greenpeace were swamped by the White House pomp in which Mr Clinton and three past US presidents this week endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But the environmental activists, who momentarily disrupted a House hearing to unfurl a 15 foot anti-Nafta banner, saw their stunt repeated again and again on evening news shows.
With dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots organisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespread public hostility against the pact with Canada and Mexico.
A new Wall Street Journal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest level yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of Nafta.
The continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff announcements have hurt the pact's chances and presented the administration with a formidable challenge.
Fifty per cent of the Americans polled disagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be created than lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that US companies and workers could compete with Mexico.
Pro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the opposition's success in framing the debate against Nafta as a pact which would cost jobs.
But they took heart from Tuesday's presidential show: President Clinton's passionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced; President Carter's attack on Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, as a demagogue with 'unlimited financial resources,'; President Bush's praise of Mexican President Carlos Salinas; President Ford's warning that the country would be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given no work at home.
'It was a revival,' said Texas Congressman JJ Pickle.
'I think Nafta was born again.'
To keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President Clinton Wednesday took off for New Orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out on speaking tours across the country.
Government agencies have been mobilised for the battle, given pro-Nafta literature and instructed to boost the pact in seminars and public forums.
Congressional committees have begun to examine the details in preparation for writing its implementing legislation, now expected on the Hill in November.
It is believed this process may satisfy some of the Congressional doubters, who are demanding a 'level playing field' and a speedup of Mexican tariff reductions.
Pro and anti-Nafta forces are keeping the fax lines burning.
A Greenpeace release warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would be undermined if the pact is approved.
In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental, citizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus and other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental side pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta's environmental safeguards.
Seemingly unfazed by Nafta's new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign, one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk' the Clinton Administration claim Nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next five years.
Unmindful of a television camera, its leaders plotted new strategies: anti-Nafta resolution in 25 state legislatures; a letter writing campaign and more.
Notable by his absence from the fray has been Mr Richard Gephardt, the House Majority Leader, who is said to be close to moving from tentative to committed opposition.
He will join forces with Congressman David Bonior, the majority whip, and three of Mr Bonior's lieutenants, leaving the House Speaker, Tom Foley, nearly alone on the defence, among the leadership.
'I do not think we have articulated well - the supporters of Nafta - the very positive and energetic reasons that can be offered for supporting this,' Mr Foley acknowledged.
Without Nafta, the US relationship with Mexico could 'deteriorate,' and 'much of what people are worried about will happen, perhaps more speedily without Nafta than with it.
Those things have to be presented more forcefully.'","Pro- and anti- forces in the battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) displayed their respective strengths this week.
President Clinton and former Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford all endorsed NAFTA.
Opponents interrupted a House hearing to unfurl an anti-NAFTA banner and succeeded in getting extensive free TV coverage.
Meanwhile polls showed growing public opposition to the trade pact with 36% of those polled opposed and 25% in favor.
A Greenpeace release claimed that the agreement threatens two decades of work on environmental protection, but Vice President Gore and several established environmental leaders praised the environmental safeguards negotiated in NAFTA's side pact.","[[81, 176], [1353, 1370], [1450, 1466], [1574, 1588], [1635, 1649], [186, 209], [227, 264], [273, 290], [296, 354], [589, 627], [629, 662], [673, 719], [2569, 2693], [2794, 2816], [2818, 2879], [2881, 2952], [2964, 3001], [3022, 3061], [118, 127], [137, 176], [227, 290], [1869, 1878], [1903, 2043]]"

"The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave of public concern.
New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain disorder similar to BSE.
Richard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading critic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance.
He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease.
'
Our worst predictions are coming true,' he said.
'I find it unbelievable that the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling the public there is no danger.'
The advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer Kenneth Calman and chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old Duncan Templeman - following that of Peter Warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features that give cause for undue concern'.
The official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, even though it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a disease as rare as CJD.
Robert Will of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, who has been monitoring CJD in the UK since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with BSE-affected herds.
One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD.
'
Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said.
'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.'
Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually occurs in late middle age.
The handful of patients known to have developed CJD through infection (from contaminated human growth hormone) showed a different pattern of symptoms.
The second annual report of Will's National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 UK cases in the year ended April 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3.
But the report says that this is not statistically significant and is probably due to increasing awareness of CJD (some cases were previously attributed to Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia).
Meanwhile, cattle are succumbing to BSE at a rate of about one per 100 every year.
The epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture's predictions that it is about to wane; so far this year there have been 26,695 reported cases, compared with 25,898 to the same date last year.
The source of infection was protein-rich cattle feed contaminated with scrapie, a related brain disease of sheep.
Although sheep-derived feeds were banned from sale in 1988, farmers apparently continued to use existing stocks for longer than the ministry had expected.
The incubation period is also longer than originally expected.
Veterinary experts say that almost all of the 102,000 confirmed BSE cases so far can be attributed to scrapie-contaminated feed.
According to their investigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf - which would prolong the epidemic - is very rare or non-existent.
Scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: BSE, scrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology.
Recent research shows that the prion is an abnormal form of a protein that is normally present in the brain (though its normal function is not yet known).
Unlike viruses and bacteria, prions contain no genetic material of their own.
The prion may arise by a genetic mutation (spontaneous or inherited) in the host animal.
Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.
Once in place in the victim's brain, it catalyses what John Collinge, a prion researcher at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, called a slow 'chemical chain reaction', converting the normal protein into its own abnormal form.
The prion molecule is folded in a way that makes it extremely stable and therefore difficult to destroy by conventional sterilisation.
Experiments show that BSE can be transmitted between species, for example from cow to monkey, by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue.
But 'transmission is dose dependent,' Collinge says.
Most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef eater - is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease.","Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK is causing increased public concern.
A second dairy farmer has died of a related human brain disorder, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) causing some to maintain that BSE can trigger CJD.
BSE, CJD and scrapie, the ovine form of the disease, are all caused by an abnormal form of protein, the prion, that converts normal protein into its own abnormal form.

The prion molecule is folded in a way that makes it extremely stable and therefore difficult to destroy by conventional sterilisation.
Experiments show that BSE can be transmitted between species, for example from cow to monkey, by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue.
But 'transmission is dose dependent,' Collinge says.
Most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef eater - is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease.","New cases of mad cow disease"", or BSE, are still being reported at a rate of about 1000 per week.
Last month a second dairy farmer, Mr. Duncan Templeman, succumbed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human brain ailment similar to BSE.
The new cases and the deaths of two dairy farmers have prompted a new wave of public criticism of the government officials who stoutly maintain that there is no evidence that BSE contributed to the deaths.
The government still insists that scrapie-contaminated feed is the cause of the reported cases of BSE.","[[16, 69], [168, 198], [206, 218], [223, 321], [994, 1010], [127, 166], [168, 177], [243, 248], [444, 450], [461, 475], [806, 820], [904, 932], [1120, 1187], [3579, 3596], [3605, 3678]]"
"The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave of public concern.
New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain disorder similar to BSE.
Richard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading critic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance.
He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease.
'
Our worst predictions are coming true,' he said.
'I find it unbelievable that the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling the public there is no danger.'
The advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer Kenneth Calman and chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old Duncan Templeman - following that of Peter Warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features that give cause for undue concern'.
The official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, even though it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a disease as rare as CJD.
Robert Will of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, who has been monitoring CJD in the UK since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with BSE-affected herds.
One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD.
'
Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said.
'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.'
Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually occurs in late middle age.
The handful of patients known to have developed CJD through infection (from contaminated human growth hormone) showed a different pattern of symptoms.
The second annual report of Will's National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 UK cases in the year ended April 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3.
But the report says that this is not statistically significant and is probably due to increasing awareness of CJD (some cases were previously attributed to Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia).
Meanwhile, cattle are succumbing to BSE at a rate of about one per 100 every year.
The epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture's predictions that it is about to wane; so far this year there have been 26,695 reported cases, compared with 25,898 to the same date last year.
The source of infection was protein-rich cattle feed contaminated with scrapie, a related brain disease of sheep.
Although sheep-derived feeds were banned from sale in 1988, farmers apparently continued to use existing stocks for longer than the ministry had expected.
The incubation period is also longer than originally expected.
Veterinary experts say that almost all of the 102,000 confirmed BSE cases so far can be attributed to scrapie-contaminated feed.
According to their investigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf - which would prolong the epidemic - is very rare or non-existent.
Scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: BSE, scrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology.
Recent research shows that the prion is an abnormal form of a protein that is normally present in the brain (though its normal function is not yet known).
Unlike viruses and bacteria, prions contain no genetic material of their own.
The prion may arise by a genetic mutation (spontaneous or inherited) in the host animal.
Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.
Once in place in the victim's brain, it catalyses what John Collinge, a prion researcher at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, called a slow 'chemical chain reaction', converting the normal protein into its own abnormal form.
The prion molecule is folded in a way that makes it extremely stable and therefore difficult to destroy by conventional sterilisation.
Experiments show that BSE can be transmitted between species, for example from cow to monkey, by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue.
But 'transmission is dose dependent,' Collinge says.
Most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef eater - is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease.","Ten thousand animals in Britain have been killed by ""mad cow"" disease (BSE), with almost 1,000 new cases a week.
Last week a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease (CJD).
One professor believes exposure to BSE, not chance, caused the CJD.
Government officials claim it is only a coincidence, because both diseases have long incubation periods and patients who developed CJD from growth hormones had different symptoms.
Annual cases of CJD in the UK are growing.
BSE and CJD are caused by a prion, an abnormal form of a protein normally present in the brain, which may arise spontaneously or hereditarily or be transferred from another animal.","[[53, 88], [107, 124], [318, 321], [168, 218], [234, 288], [323, 362], [514, 607], [1120, 1187], [1637, 1674], [3488, 3524], [3615, 3618], [2347, 2383], [2403, 2407], [2427, 2441], [2443, 2481], [3891, 3894], [3904, 3927], [3959, 3964], [4053, 4129], [4255, 4274], [4298, 4309], [4310, 4322], [4344, 4346], [4370, 4403], [2494, 2507], [2585, 2601], [2617, 2623], [2635, 2652], [2662, 2670]]"
"INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern border of Zimbabwe.
De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South Africa.
After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production as Venetia, one of the world's biggest diamond mines.
The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991 after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about marketing the diamonds.
The government insists that all minerals are sold through its state-controlled Minerals Marketing Corporation.
Mr Robin Baxter-Brown, chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines, one of the new joint owners of River Ranch, said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving.
Also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines.
(A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site before it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that River Ranch had been bulldozed.)
Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience.
He helped Auridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was once chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put up for tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.
The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in March last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of gem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.
Redaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds 780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to 330,000 carats.
The increase will be reached in two phases.
The first, costing USDollars 2.1m, will raise output to 180,000 carats next year, while the second will cost Dollars 8.7m.
The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy and move a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZ Corporation's diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.
The joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of ground around the mine and Mr Baxter-Brown suggested the chances of finding another diamond deposit were good.
While most of River Ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half a carat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6 carats.
A 28-carat stone was sold for Dollars 110,000 or Dollars 4,000 a carat, and one of 17 carats for Dollars 95,000 (Dollars 6,000 a carat).
Diamonds are being sold directly to the market in Antwerp, Belgium, and not through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of the world rough (uncut) diamond trade.
But as Mr Baxter-Brown pointed out: '330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.'","An Australian based company, known as Auridiam, is raising capital to further develop the River Ranch diamond mine located in Southern Zimbabwe.

"The welfare state, the glue that binds the social fabric of the world's advanced capitalist economies, is coming unstuck.
The immediate cause is its increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.
In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.
While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war.
Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.
Total government spending in the OECD countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990.
The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.
Social security payments more than doubled during this period, from 7 per cent of GDP to 15.4 per cent.
Health expenditure also doubled, from 3.9 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.
Expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades, more than doubling its average share of GDP in OECD countries since 1960.
Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure over this period.
The growth is largely attributable to three factors: The increase in coverage as pension schemes introduced after the second world war mature.
The rise in the number of elderly people.
Improvements in pension benefits, such as automatic increases to match rising earnings.
The maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the doubling of health expenditure since 1960.
Countries such as Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to provide universal coverage.
As with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental.
The ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.
Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity benefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older workers.
Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes.
For example, governments have become much less willing to offer improvements in pensions.
Moves are afoot in countries such as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age.
Automatic indexation of pensions to earnings has been weakened in Germany and ended altogether in the UK for the basic flat-rate pension.
Healthcare systems have been reformed to make them more efficient and to bear down on the cost of pharmaceuticals.
Although there are considerable differences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries such as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models that use competition and price incentives to control costs.
Many countries have also begun to tighten up on unemployment benefits, with reductions in benefit levels and more rigorous conditions to qualify.
Active labour market policies have been introduced to promote a return to employment.
Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these.
But what most concerns those responsible for public finances is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push costs upwards in the future.
The most important of these is demography.
Increases in life expectancy have already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions.
The number of over-65s in the 24 OECD member states rose from 61m in 1960 to more than 100m in 1990.
The growth is accelerating, with the number projected to rise to more than 115m in 2000, 131m in 2010 and 156m by 2020.
Only halfway through the 21st century will the number of over-65s peak, at about 190m. The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age.
The standard measure for this is the age dependency ratio, the population over 65 as a percentage of the population aged 15-64.
For the OECD as a whole, the age dependency ratio is predicted to rise from about 19 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent by 2020 and 37 per cent by 2040.
Some countries face much greater pressures from the ageing of their populations than others.
Germany and Japan, for example, will both have age dependency ratios of 34 per cent by 2020 - one person over the age of 65 for every three people between 15 and 64.
By 2040, almost half of Germany's population could be over 65, though the proportion will fall thereafter.
Age dependency ratios will climb more slowly in the UK and US, to about 25 per cent in 2020 - four people of working age to support every elderly person.
In both countries, ratios will peak at about 33 per cent in 2040.
The most immediate impact of these demographic changes will be on pensions, where costs will in any case rise as pension schemes continue to mature.
Overall, the OECD estimates that the pension burden could double over the next 50 years.
Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the pensions do not increase in real terms.
In practice, increasing pensions in line with prices might be difficult to sustain if earnings rose faster.
The growing gap between pensioners and those still at work that would result could be politically unacceptable.
However, raising pensions by more than prices would either require much higher growth rates or higher taxes for those in work to pay the bill.
The impact of an ageing population on healthcare costs is less clear-cut.
Experts differ on whether increased longevity inevitably means more medical care: while more might be required for the very elderly, less might be needed for younger people as chronic diseases become less common.
Additional costs of new drugs and advances in medical technology could be at least as important as demography in pushing up healthcare bills.
However, there will be an increase in demand for geriatric care and social services for the elderly.
This will be encouraged by social changes, such as the decline of the extended family in which older people were cared for by younger relatives.
Other changes in social structure are also pushing up the demands on the welfare state.
Throughout the OECD, for example, the number of lone-parent families has been rising since the 1960s.
In some countries, the increase has been relatively moderate - 20 per cent or less in countries such as France, Japan and Switzerland.
At the other extreme, the increase has exceeded 50 per cent in the UK and Australia.
In the US the number has more than doubled.
Lone-parent families now typically constitute 10-15 per cent of of all families with children in OECD countries.
In the US it is one in four families.
The reasons for the growth include the greater ease of separation and divorce.
But inevitably lone-parent families rely on welfare provision to a far greater extent than two-parent families.
Added to concerns over demography and social change are fears over the increase in unemployment levels across the OECD.
Over the past two decades, jobless levels have risen during recessions but not fallen back to the same extent in the following recovery period.
This ratchet effect has worried the Group of Seven leading industrial countries sufficiently for an employment summit to be hosted by President Clinton in the coming months.
Continuing rises in the base level of unemployment would further undermine countries' ability to pay for their welfare states.
Responses to these cost pressures vary from country to country.
Germany, the UK, France, Italy and the US are among countries that have already raised tax and social security contribution levels.
However, the scope for such increases is limited by voters' reluctance to pay higher taxes.
Where the cost of welfare is jointly funded by employers - as in Germany - higher contributions are also increasingly resisted by business, which fears the consequences for international competitiveness of higher costs.
In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.
An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state.
But that would also have deleterious effects, according to the OECD.
Average government debt in OECD countries has risen from 23 per cent of GDP in 1979 to 44 per cent in 1992.
Without either tax rises or cuts in welfare budgets, current welfare spending plans could increase debt ratios on average by 90 percentage points over the next 40 years, according to one OECD study.
It says this is 'a situation which most would think unsustainable'.
This is why the OECD's half-yearly Economic Outlook repeatedly stresses the importance of controlling welfare spending in improving economic performance.
The OECD's immediate priorities for reform include charges for the use of some welfare services and greater competition to increase the efficiency of those services.
But the OECD has also drawn attention to the need for action to anticipate the funding implications of the rise in the number of elderly people.
Tackling these longer-term pressures will require more than tinkering with charges and efficiency drives in welfare services.
Significant cuts in benefit levels, for example, may be needed - including greater targeting of benefits on the most needy.
User charges could become increasingly widespread, especially for the better-off.
They could rise to cover a much larger part of the costs of welfare services.
And the demands put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private provision of pensions and healthcare.
Measures such as these would fundamentally change the nature of the welfare state, however.
From providing support 'from the cradle to the grave', it would become a safety net for those who could not afford to provide for themselves.
As countries become wealthier, moving the boundary between the state's responsibilities and those of the individual in this way may be a natural step.
But it would be politically controversial.
Yet it is increasingly clear that there is no alternative to fundamental reforms if advanced economies are to protect their most vulnerable citizens without imposing unacceptable burdens on economic performance.
The welfare state may have effectively bound societies together through the ups and downs of the economic cycle for the past 40 years.
But a new glue will be needed over the next 50 years if advanced economies are to pass beyond the welfare state.
This is the first in a series of articles analysing the pressures on the welfare state across the world, and examining policy options for relieving the strain","Fundamental welfare reform is needed within the 24 member nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation if these states are to protect their most vulnerable citizens without endangering their economies.
Welfare costs, principally for pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support are rapidly becoming insupportable.
The costliest item is pensions, which continue to grow due to increased coverage, benefit levels and an aging population.
By the year 2040, people over age 65 will rise from their current 19% of total population to 37%.
In a competitive global economy, no country can burden its businesses with higher welfare costs than its neighbors.","[[211, 277], [11111, 11242], [11256, 11287], [506, 535], [542, 562], [1142, 1260], [1531, 1560], [1434, 1445], [1460, 1464], [1488, 1490], [1521, 1529], [1531, 1552], [1757, 1770], [1779, 1794], [1814, 1834], [1900, 1940], [1942, 1974], [4833, 4897], [4953, 4977], [4994, 5003], [5010, 5032], [5057, 5076], [8938, 8967], [8985, 9020], [9036, 9097]]"
"The welfare state, the glue that binds the social fabric of the world's advanced capitalist economies, is coming unstuck.
The immediate cause is its increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.
In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.
While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war.
Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.
Total government spending in the OECD countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990.
The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.
Social security payments more than doubled during this period, from 7 per cent of GDP to 15.4 per cent.
Health expenditure also doubled, from 3.9 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.
Expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades, more than doubling its average share of GDP in OECD countries since 1960.
Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure over this period.
The growth is largely attributable to three factors: The increase in coverage as pension schemes introduced after the second world war mature.
The rise in the number of elderly people.
Improvements in pension benefits, such as automatic increases to match rising earnings.
The maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the doubling of health expenditure since 1960.
Countries such as Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to provide universal coverage.
As with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental.
The ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.
Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity benefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older workers.
Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes.
For example, governments have become much less willing to offer improvements in pensions.
Moves are afoot in countries such as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age.
Automatic indexation of pensions to earnings has been weakened in Germany and ended altogether in the UK for the basic flat-rate pension.
Healthcare systems have been reformed to make them more efficient and to bear down on the cost of pharmaceuticals.
Although there are considerable differences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries such as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models that use competition and price incentives to control costs.
Many countries have also begun to tighten up on unemployment benefits, with reductions in benefit levels and more rigorous conditions to qualify.
Active labour market policies have been introduced to promote a return to employment.
Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these.
But what most concerns those responsible for public finances is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push costs upwards in the future.

Combined with social changes - more one-parent families and the decline of the extended family - increased geriatric services and welfare will be necessary.","[[180, 195], [218, 293], [295, 329], [342, 355], [364, 375], [380, 395], [485, 500], [1198, 1260], [506, 514], [536, 604], [1154, 1206], [2297, 2337], [4248, 4348], [2143, 2152], [2196, 2277], [7983, 8014], [3140, 3155], [3195, 3219], [3340, 3357], [8477, 8515], [8621, 8671], [10255, 10277], [6879, 6933], [6998, 7056], [7238, 7288], [7815, 7851], [7862, 7866], [7871, 7885]]"

After seven long years, the US Congress this week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations of Mr Robert Kennedy and Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968.
The legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on purchases of handguns.
It would give law enforcement authorities time to check the buyer's background.
Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over stubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho and Alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the US.
The Brady bill's opponents in Congress say it will inconvenience only law-abiding citizens, not criminals who buy or steal their weapons away from the government's prying eyes.
They point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the 276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill's likely ineffectiveness.
For instance, one newspaper reporter successfully obtained a dealer's licence for his dog by submitting a made-up social security number.
Studies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest, however, that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped, and some suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun.
But even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that it will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of new or used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation; and will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidental deaths involving guns each year.
'The longest journey begins with a single step,' Mr Brady said after the bill's final passage in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite its uncertain effect, passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control.
Other initiatives in Congress and in state legislatures are under way: the Senate last week agreed in a separate bill to ban assault weapons, a measure already in force in California, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Virginia has passed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month.
With the federal government considering the imposition of punitive taxes on some particularly devastating types of ammunition, the Winchester company recently decided to withdraw its Black Talon bullet.
This is prized by some game hunters for its killing power but detested by emergency room doctors for the damage it inflicts on humans as it mushrooms on impact.
The strength of public feeling about rampant gun use has clearly grown in the face of an apparently unstoppable wave of urban violence that has brought the rate of death by shooting among young black men to more than 150 per 100,000, and led to the installation of metal detectors in city schools.
The fear of violent crimes such as carjackings and drive-by shootings has spread even beyond the inner city and into the suburbs and the countryside, provoking a widespread feeling that something - anything - must be done.
The message from an outraged public is not, however, unequivocally in favour of gun control.
Paradoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their Republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the Brady bill, thousands have also been flocking to join the National Rifle Association, the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies.
In the past year and a half, it has gained 1,000 members a day to bring its total, which had declined to about 2.6m in 1991, to a record of about 3.3m. Many new members and gun owners are women.
Recent election results have shown, too, that simply being tough on guns is not enough to woo the voters.
Although Democratic Governor Jim Florio of New Jersey came close to victory in the gubernatorial race this month by striking a tougher stance on both guns and crime in general than his Republican challenger, Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, this was not enough.
Voters were swayed by economic considerations and particularly by his first-term tax increase.
In Virginia, meanwhile, Ms Mary Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate for governor, relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by Mr George Allen, her Republican opponent, who did not favour tighter curbs but promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole.
While such results do not indicate that the NRA has been routed, they have put the association on the defensive.
Most members now favour some form of gun control, but the core membership opposes all restraints on the sale of firearms.
Their beliefs are rooted in an almost theological - some would say fanatical - interpretation of the second amendment to the US constitution, which states that: 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'
'The second amendment is not about duck-hunting.
In the 1990s, it is about self-defence,' says Mr James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief Washington lobbyist.
To many members, the right to self-defence is not just against muggers or burglars, but against a tyrannical government.
Mr Neal Knox, sacked from a lobbying position with the NRA in the 1980s but now one of its elected directors, argues that the second amendment is the citizen's 'freedom insurance plan' against tyranny.
Mr Knox says the Holocaust would not have happened if Europe's Jews had owned rifles, and if the Nazis had not been able to confiscate guns, thanks to gun registration laws passed in the 1930s.
He also contends that the solution to Somalia's problems is to arm Somali mothers with AK-47s.
Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine guns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets.
In the process they have lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and specifically the Brady bill.
Two trends over the past few years have weakened the advocates of gun rights.
First, left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a supplement to tough anti-crime measures, rather than an alternative; they have recaptured much of the 'tough on crime' high ground by backing boot camps for young delinquents, harsher sentences and stiffer restrictions on parole or habeas corpus appeals.
The NRA is trying to fight back with a campaign called CrimeStrike, calling for harsher measures against criminals.
Second, the NRA's insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed as reasonable by a majority not just of the US population but of gun-owners, has driven away some former political and police supporters.
Senator Denis DeConcini of Arizona, once voted the NRA's 'legislator of the month', is backing a ban on assault weapons.
Delegate Clinton Miller of the Virginia state assembly, once rated 'A+' by the NRA, now calls the organisation's top members 'hateful, spiteful, arrogant'.
This alienation is apparent among gun-owners at large.
According to a Gallup poll earlier this year, 57 per cent of people who said they had a gun in their house also favoured stricter laws on the sale of firearms.
These converts to gun control, however, are a long way from believing that the answer to violent crime lies in more radical action, such as the proposal of Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, for a complete ban on handguns.
Some Americans may move in this direction, but many more may put their faith in self-defence and buy their own weapons.","The U.S. Congress this week passed the Brady Bill, its first significant gun- control law since 1968.
Last week the Senate agreed to a ban on assault weapons.
Perhaps the tide has changed in favor of gun control.
On the other hand, election results show that a strong stand on gun control does not get candidates elected, and membership in the National Rifle Association has soared in the last two years.
Although most of its members favor some degree of gun control the NRA's hard core opposes all restraints on the sale of firearms, arguing that firearms represent the best defense not only against criminals but against tyranny.","[[56, 132], [206, 210], [239, 253], [2141, 2168], [2188, 2210], [2001, 2032], [2044, 2068], [3801, 3828], [3835, 3839], [3847, 3898], [3473, 3545], [3599, 3626], [4640, 4652], [4657, 4688], [4690, 4760], [5244, 5265], [5278, 5305], [5454, 5493], [5513, 5544]]"

The NRA, with 3.3 million members, claims that legislation will not stem crime; the answer is stiffer penalties, longer sentences and abolition of parole.
Further they believe that gun ownership is necessary to prevent takeover by a despotic government.
The Second Amendment is their rallying point.
Gun Control has become a pivotal issue in many elections, influencing who wins, who loses.","[[3349, 3597], [5466, 5544], [5559, 5738], [7028, 7093], [63, 71], [82, 88], [93, 98], [123, 132], [206, 210], [239, 253], [395, 452], [463, 532], [783, 792], [805, 871], [3515, 3545], [3631, 3634], [3648, 3655], [3736, 3738], [3745, 3749], [4483, 4525], [6410, 6427], [6489, 6499], [6557, 6603], [5395, 5402], [5454, 5544], [4762, 4792], [4800, 4811], [4841, 4879], [2720, 2790], [4252, 4263], [4295, 4391], [4409, 4466]]"
"On May 6 the Queen and President Mitterrand will declare the Channel Tunnel open.
That should be the starting signal for a recovery in the property market in Kent and north eastern France.
At the moment, agents report more inquiries, but the markets in both countries are still quiet and prices low, especially in France.
That is an excellent long-term reason to buy.
Le Shuttle's high starting prices for a vehicle and its passengers will eventually come down creating price competition between rail, ferry, catamaran and Hovercraft.
Far-sighted prospective buyers looking near Calais include hauliers wanting to set up a base on the Continent, and Asian entrepreneurs who see an advantage in being close to Belgium.
John Hart, author of A House in France, notes: 'It is not a rush.
The tunnel does not mean much to the continentals.
Most of the ferry trade is from Britain to France.'
The British are mainly looking for houses, rather than apartments, although French and Dutch buyers are also in the market.
Inquiries about northern French property picked up just before Christmas, says Maggie Kelly, of French agents L'Abri-tanique in Hesdin.
Growing confidence in the UK market is slowly stimulating interest in French property.
UK buyers can now sell their UK home to put money into a main residence or second home in France.
Prices have stopped falling in northern France and hopes are high that the tunnel, motorways and new railways will resuscitate the region.
Britons who bought in 1989 or 1990 may find it a good time to sell, if they did not pay too much at the time and have renovated their properties since.
But some paid far too much.
Spectacular price cuts can be found.
For example, a glorious, repossessed abbey with five acres in Tortefontaine, with a 12th century hall and many outbuildings, is on sale at around FFr750,000 (Pounds 86,000) from agents Latitudes or L'Abri-tanique.
Four or five years ago it cost FFr2.5m (after being put on the market at FFr4m).
A mill near Montreuil, which cost FFr2m in 1989, sold last year for FFr500,000.
French banks and mortgage providers have taken it 'on the chin', said Kelly, and some smaller banks in Calais are none too happy when Britons seek loans.
However, show you have the cash and there are bargains to be had.
A house in Hesdin, or a nearby country cottage, make good weekend retreats and are far cheaper than their English equivalents.
A small house in Montreuil, a walled town with cobbled streets, costs FFr280,000 from La Residence.
A small, partly-restored farmhouse near Montreuil can be bought for FFr135,000 from A House in France.
Thirty minutes' drive from Boulogne, a long, low, Norman-style, half-timbered, farmhouse is for sale at FFr515,250, and 50 minutes away another costs FFr436,800 (reduced from FFr650,000).
Near St Omer agent Cote d'Opale is selling an 18th century chateau with wings added in 1908 for FFr4.46m. La Residence offers another with 28 watercress beds and 12 hectares (30 acres) in good condition for FFr2.6m and a flat in town for FFr380,000.
In Hesdin, the Wine Society, an English-based group of wine enthusiasts, has an outlet for members where they can pick up society-recommended wines free of UK taxes.
When Kelly sees Range Rover and Jaguar drivers collecting their cases of wine in Hesdin, she would like them to drop into her office 100 metres away and choose a house as well.
Latitudes has on its books an 18th century town house with internal courtyard for FFr1.3m, a snip when you think what you would pay in Paris.
Near Fruges is a water mill for FFr900,000 and, in the valley of the Ternoise, an 18th century brick house needing work is available for just FFr450,000.
On the coast, Boulogne is a smart, pleasant town far preferable to Calais.
It has good shops - including the Philippe Olivier cheese shop - and restaurants.
The French favourite is Le Touquet, still an elegant place for Parisians to spend le weekend.
Shops open in winter on Saturdays and Sundays -and close on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings.
You can play golf and tennis, ride, go to the casino and live in an elegant domaine in the Foret.
As in Deauville, the town's cachet has kept prices up.
Penny Zoldan, of Latitudes, has a flat in Le Touquet and sees it as a good base for foreigners.
Nearby, at Hardelot, there are plenty of building plots for sale beside the two golf courses (consult Latitudes).
Outside Le Touquet, A House in France offers a chateau complete with fortification wall and tunnels for FFr1.3m. In the countryside beyond Dieppe, a typical Norman house, restored and including most of the furniture and a cottage, is for sale for Pounds 125,000 from Domus Abroad.
Towards Paris, off the autoroute from Calais, Philip Hawkes is selling the 18th century Chateau de Pronleroy for FFr13m. Egerton and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley is offering the more recent Chateau de la Chaussee, near Chantilly, the centre of French racing, at FFr19m.
At the other end of the tunnel Cluttons reports Belgians and Dutch registering at the Canterbury office for period cottages for around Pounds 200,000, and French and Belgians at the Folkestone office - where David Parry reports that Arabs are interested in blocks of flats on the sea front. '
The tunnel has more psychological impact than anything.
Vendors see it as a bonus.
Buyers don't see that yet.'
Once the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the area and people will move in.
Central and east Kent need a stimulus but it may take four or five years before there is any evidence of new opportunities in the area.
An apartment in The Grand at Folkestone, the former hotel, is for sale from Cluttons for Pounds 89,500.
Along the M2, Strutt &amp; Parker offers 52 St Margaret's Street, Rochester, a Grade II* late 17th century house, for Pounds 190,000, and a Tudor (1508) and Georgian Kentish hall, Cobrahamsole Hall at Sheldwich near Faversham for Pounds 275,000.
Lane Fox is selling the half-timbered Manor Farmhouse at Milstead, near Sittingbourne, for Pounds 275,000.
In the old Cinque Port of Deal, Strutt &amp; Parker and Bright &amp; Bright offer Woodbine, a Georgian house with walled garden and studio, for Pounds 330,000.
Cluttons' Canterbury office and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith are selling Highland Court, at Bridge, a columned stately home, for Pounds 750,000.

"Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.
I entirely concur with their choice.
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.
Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner.
In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe.
He has a deadly innocence.
No wonder the Majors liked this film.
John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's.
If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing.
Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.
Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'.
(Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.)
And Major replied: 'It's simple.
My father was a farmer.
He lived on a small farm somewhere in Shropshire.'
Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910.
As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire.
This, of course, does not mean that Major made everything up.
Family folklore is a peculiar thing.
Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, as part of his American tour.
I recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city.
A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . .
.
a pattern emerges.
Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people.
If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making.
But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach to wider political issues.
On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe.
On the other he is free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics.
There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is a typical democratic politician, that one who wants to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one.
But that has not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessors.
Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician'.
No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his unsettled family background.
His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus.
No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.
The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.
Except in the movies.
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator","John Major, it seems, can be all things to all people.
Recently, when asked how he had so much empathy with agriculture, Major told an interviewer for Farm Weekly that his father had been a farmer in 1910; 33 years before Major was born.
Major also told an American audience in Pittsburgh that his father had worked there is a steel worker.
Wanting to be all things to all people he can appeal to the pro-Europeans by saying he wants Britain to be at the heart of Europe while at the same time insulting the European Commission when appealing to an audience of Euro-skeptics.","[[2231, 2241], [2251, 2282], [1014, 1029], [1051, 1065], [1067, 1082], [1100, 1128], [1130, 1144], [1155, 1187], [1196, 1220], [1510, 1531], [1548, 1555], [1579, 1636], [1894, 1918], [2020, 2055], [2112, 2162], [2475, 2510], [2528, 2584], [2586, 2624], [2639, 2662], [2689, 2730]]"
"Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.
I entirely concur with their choice.
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.
Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner.
In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe.
He has a deadly innocence.
No wonder the Majors liked this film.
John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's.
If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing.
Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.
Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'.
(Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.)
And Major replied: 'It's simple.
My father was a farmer.
He lived on a small farm somewhere in Shropshire.'
Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910.
As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire.
This, of course, does not mean that Major made everything up.
Family folklore is a peculiar thing.
Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, as part of his American tour.
I recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city.
A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . .
.
a pattern emerges.
Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people.
If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making.
But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach to wider political issues.
On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe.
On the other he is free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics.

I heartily concur with their choice.
John Major must appreciate the similarities between himself and Chauncey.
Like Chauncey whose bromides seem to convey whatever people want to believe they heard, Major is a chameleon.
For the pro- Europeans, he says he wants Britain to be at the heart of Europe, but before an audience of Euro-sceptics he freely insults the European Commission.

"It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it.
Out are the eminences gris of Victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade.
This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg.
They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today:
George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide.
The winner will be revealed on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature.
Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian novels.
But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction.
It raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years.
First, the similarities.
A good yarn is a good yarn.
Of the 1894 books, Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts.
The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons.
On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend.
All the books on both lists are gripping stories.
The lists share key themes.
Both, for instance, have books about colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which is set in the First World War in German East Africa.
Both provoke in similar ways.
The controversial books of 1894 were Trilby, with its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver.
It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it.
A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains vexed.
Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics.
But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century.
For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.
Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such as Hollinghurst's, and popular bestsellers by writers like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland.
This is the gap the Booker tries to bridge by giving high-level publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience.
The trick works - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copies.
Before the short-list was announced it sold 10,600.
The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction.
Novels accounted for 20 per cent of published books, and no distinction was made between high and low art.
In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today.
Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies.
All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later.
Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894?
Social, cultural and psychological reasons play a part.
Socially, the 1890s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite.
The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction was irrelevant.
Culturally, these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their political and intellectual forum.
Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age.
Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow.
The dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents.
George du Maurier originally offered the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel.
Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC.
The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have TV soaps.
Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would die, and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved.
Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear features of the novel in 1894.
Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage, feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed.
The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet are set back from them.
Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression.
It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today.
Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the 1994 books are historical (such as Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia (such as Beside the Ocean of Time).
Which book will win on October 15?
Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the setting of The Ebb Tide.
Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery.
My vote goes to Trilby.
Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in its anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written works have faded from memory.
Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller.","The winner of the Booker Prize for 1944 will be announced on 11 October.

"The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?' from many in the publishing industry.

The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.
As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make the grade'.
The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award.
Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace.
But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever.
One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.

" America's senior military officer Tuesday endorsed the East Bloc's move toward a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact counterparts that the United States and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive military operation against Eastern Europe.
 At a meeting in Vienna, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cited ""initial evidence"" that the Warsaw Pact is restructuring its forces in line with new defensive military doctrines in the wake of the Cold War.
Despite the encouraging signs, the West's key concern remains ""the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed, trained and suited for offensive ground operations,"" Powell said in prepared remarks at a Vienna session of defense chiefs representing 35 nations from both the East and the West.
 ""Throughout Eastern Europe we see the dramatic movement toward political pluralism,"" Powell said.
""For the United States, as for any democracy, glasnost -- public discussions and debates over military strategy and programs -- is as important as perestroika.
For through real glasnost, national security and military policies will no longer be the purview of the few but the responsibility of the many.""
 Powell's remarks appeared to be directed primarily at the chiefs of Eastern Europe's military organizations, whose future roles in the Warsaw Pact are uncertain as a result of the the major domestic upheavals that have swept their nations.
 Powell also met Tuesday for the first time with the Soviet chief of staff, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, an encounter that officials said would allow Powell to raise further questions about the Soviets' efforts to restructure their military forces.
 U.S. military intelligence officials have complained that while the Soviets say they are reshaping their forces for defensive operations, they continue to deploy large supplies of spare weapons parts and huge ammunition caches near the East-West border, where they could be used by troops in an offensive operation.
If the forces had genuinely renounced offensive operations, the analysts said, the supply and ammunition sites would be withdrawn from the border.
 The Vienna meeting came as the East European nations, several of which sent new defense chiefs to represent them, are debating the roles of their militaries at home and in potential joint military actions with the Soviet Union.
 Several of those countries, including Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, have moved to impose extraordinary new restrictions on the use of their troops outside their national territories -- gestures that Powell appeared to applaud.
 Contrasting the postwar origin of the Atlantic Alliance with that of the Warsaw Pact, Powell said that in Eastern Europe, ""the instruments of war were replaced by the instruments of coercion.
Throughout the capitals of Eastern Europe, the liberated became the occupied.""
 Powell delivered his remarks on the first day of an unprecedented ""military doctrine seminar"" organized by a 35-nation forum that negotiates limitations on the military operations and practices of its member countries, most of which are European nations.
 Saying the seminar's task ""is to help shape a new order in Europe,"" Powell defended U.S. military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet forces sent in to reinforce the first wave of a Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe.
 ""This NATO commitment to preserve territorial integrity at every potential point of attack . . .
explains the NATO strategy of bringing force to bear on successive echelons of attacking forces,"" Powell said, noting that NATO would be overwhelmed quickly if it had to face the full brunt of the Warsaw Pact's tank armies.
 ""Under no circumstances, however, does this imply the alliance's intent to invade and seize territory,"" Powell said.
 He also echoed suggestions by other U.S. officials that American ground forces will shrink significantly in response to changed military threats in Europe, while the U.S. Navy is expected to remain large.
","At a meeting in Vienna, General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, endorsed the East Bloc's move toward a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact (WP) counterparts that the US and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive military operation against Eastern Europe.
However, he defended US military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet reinforcement forces for WP first-wave attack.
There is intelligence information that the Soviets still have large supplies of spare weapons parts and ammunition near the East-West border available for an offensive operation.","[[43, 271], [273, 356], [3220, 3409], [1711, 1749], [1761, 1772], [1823, 1833], [1852, 1949], [1957, 1975], [1986, 2011]]"
" A white Long Beach police officer who allegedly pushed a black man through a plate-glass window during an arrest that was secretly videotaped by a television crew acknowledged Friday that he made errors in his official report.
 Officer Mark Dickey, speaking publicly for the first time since the Jan. 14 incident, told a state Senate oversight committee in sworn testimony that he had so little faith in his own report that he would not want it used against him if he were suspected of a crime.
He blamed the discrepancies on a faulty memory, saying he wrote the report more than three hours after the altercation occurred.
 Dickey, who was testifying under subpoena, admitted under questioning that the black man, Don Jackson, never used profanity during the arrest as Dickey had indicated in his report.
Dickey also admitted that he intended to inflict pain on Jackson when he put handcuffs on him as a way to control him.
 Police Misconduct Allegations Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on State Procurement and Expenditure Practices, called the hearing into the incident to review allegations of police misconduct in Long Beach.
The legislative committee monitors state funds disbursed to police departments by the state Police Officer Standards and Training Commission.
 The incident received nationwide attention after a camera hidden in Jackson's car videotaped the arrest, during which Dickey swore at Jackson after stopping his car for an alleged traffic violation and then appeared to push his head through a plate-glass window.
 Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave and a self-styled crusader against police brutality, had gone to Long Beach that night with an NBC television crew following in a separate vehicle in what he termed a ""sting"" operation to validate reports of racism and brutality by Long Beach police officers.
 Investigations have been launched by the FBI, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the Long Beach Police Department.
Dickey has been temporarily reassigned to a desk job, and Jackson was charged with interfering with a police officer.
 At the hearing, Boatwright repeatedly played the videotape while committee members and about 50 observers watched on television monitors and Dickey and Jackson commented on each scene.
 Boatwright questioned whether the car in which Jackson was riding was actually weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether Jackson acted aggressively toward the officers, as Dickey said in his report.
At one point, Boatwright asked Dickey: ""You became the judge, jury and executioner as to whether he was challenged to a fight?""
 ""No,"" Dickey tersely replied.
 Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, refused to allow Dickey to answer any more questions after nearly three hours of questioning because of what he called the ""hostile and badgering"" nature of the inquiry.
 ""This little kangaroo court gives these politicians a chance to run for office.
Any resemblance between this and a fair hearing is just imaginary,"" Hannon told reporters afterward.
""They are taking stuff out of context and just badgering him with it.""
 Earlier, under questioning by Boatwright and as the videotape was played, Dickey testified that the alleged infraction for which the Jackson car was stopped -- crossing the center divider -- occurred before it could be seen on a tape shot from the NBC chase vehicle, but he maintained that the tape does show Jackson's car weaving slowly within the traffic lane.
 Boatwright, standing in front of the television monitor, pointed out that a videotape shot from the Jackson car's rear window shows the street lights passing by in a consistent pattern -- indicating the car was not weaving.
Dickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving ""was weaving all over, too"" as it tailed Jackson's car.
 Jackson, also testifying under subpoena, said that he and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer who drove the car, took great care not to break traffic laws when they cruised along Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach.
He alleged that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, Dickey hurt him by bending his fingers while handcuffing him and pushed his face into the hood of the police car.
Also, Jackson alleged, officers refused three requests to loosen his handcuffs as he was taken to the police station.
 Dickey's eight-page police report, which was provided to reporters, states that Jackson was arrested for saying ""offensive words,"" an allegation that was later dropped.
But Dickey conceded at the hearing that it was he, not Jackson, who uttered obscenities.
 No Taunts Heard 
The report states that Jackson challenged the officer to fight, although Jackson never is heard taunting the officer on the tape.
""There can be a fight without a verbal challenge,"" Dickey said, adding that Jackson's fists were clenched at his sides.
 Dickey said that he was swearing to try to alleviate his fear.
He testified that he thought Jackson, who immediately stepped out of the car after it came to a halt, might be trying to provide a diversion for an armed partner in the car.
He said his actions were an attempt to ""accomplish my No. 1 job that night: to go home in one piece.""
At one point in the proceeding, Boatwright had Dickey and Jackson weighed in an attempt to show that Jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer.
 At another point, Boatwright assumed the role of Dickey and had Dickey play Jackson in trying to demonstrate the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during the arrest.
Boatwright contended that in using that type of hold the officer would have had to push Jackson into the window deliberately.
Dickey denied it.
The officer said Jackson's face crashed through the window when Jackson suddenly pulled forward.
Jackson, according to Dickey, struck the window with his elbows and not with his face as Jackson contends.
Dickey, who cut his hand, noted that Jackson suffered no facial injuries when the glass shattered.
 Jackson, in his testimony, defended his self-appointed role as a police anti-brutality activist, saying ""my duty is to uphold the law and I am doing that in the highest tradition.""
He said he is troubled, though, that Long Beach police are investigating his background on the Hawthorne Police Department rather than concentrating on the incident.
 Boatwright adjourned the hearing, which was held at the Hall of Administration in downtown Los Angeles, after about six hours of testimony.
He said it would reconvene later to hear from the additional witnesses.

" The wife of Capt.
Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based Vincennes, escaped unharmed Friday morning moments before a pipe bomb exploded under her van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a busy La Jolla intersection.
 Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation, suspecting that the bombing might be an act of ""domestic terrorism"" linked to the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf last July, killing 290.
The Navy and Marine Corps tightened security at every military installation in San Diego County.
 ""Certainly it raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved in this,"" said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman.
 No Motive
Yet 
 No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, a federal law enforcement official said.
 ""At this point in time, we have no motive; we have no suspect,"" said Thomas A. Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego.
""We do not rule out the possibility of retribution against Capt.
Rogers.""
However, a senior Defense Department official said that there was ""no evidence"" of a terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described the bombing as ""amateurish.""
 Nonetheless, federal officials acknowledged that the incident followed an FBI lookout report issued in San Diego in late December for a Syrian national allegedly linked to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 passengers and crew members in Scotland last year.
 A copy of the FBI document, obtained by The Times, said the Los Angeles FBI office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian, identified as Farwan Abdin, was ""involved in or responsible for the Flight 103 bombing over Scotland.""
 The FBI added: ""Also mentioned were Navy quarters or TV station.
No further information given.""
 The FBI's assessment at the time was that the call was ""shoddy"" but that efforts should be made to locate Abdin.
Officials said Friday that a serious investigation of the call was never launched.
 The Rogerses were being protected Friday night by the Naval Investigative Service and other Navy personnel at an undisclosed location.
 ""They are not home, and we will not disclose their location,"" said Chief Craig Huebler, a Navy spokesman.
""And we won't discuss it beyond that.
That gets into security, and you can understand the sensitivity to that.""
He said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for Rogers, crew members and their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego.
 ""Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different?"" he said.
""There was nothing to indicate a threat to the crew or to their families.""
 All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by their commanders Friday morning of the bomb in the Rogerses' van and urged to take whatever precautions they deemed necessary, Huebler said.
 Police and Navy officials said Rogers and his wife telephoned their son, Bill Rogers, at an eastern university, where he is a student.
They assured him that they were safe.
 After the bombing Friday, an FBI spokesman said the Rogerses' van was usually driven by Sharon Rogers, but two highly placed law enforcement sources told The Times that Will Rogers drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before the blast.
The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane on Genesee Avenue, south of La Jolla Village Drive.
A law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, said Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up behind three or four cars stopped at a red light at the intersection and then suddenly heard two popping sounds.
The official said she believed that her van had been struck in the rear by another car, so she got out and walked to the back of the van to look for damage.
 ""And then it all went up,"" the official said.
""That's all there was to it.
There were holes everywhere, and there was plenty of burn.""
The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota and ignited a fire that destroyed the vehicle.
 One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported that moments after the explosion, a red car quickly made a U-turn over the traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene.
No other description of the car was available, but witnesses said there were four people in it.
 ""It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb,"" he said, ""or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was trying not to get hurt.""
 Sharon Rogers, 50, was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at La Jolla Country Day School when the bomb went off.
 Other Vehicles Undamaged 
 Though the van was surrounded on three sides by other vehicles, none of them were damaged, witnesses said.
 ""I believe she got out just as it blew,"" said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded.
 Sharon Rogers was dazed but walking under her own power, when the laborers reached her.
They took her to a pickup truck, where she told them that she was the van's sole occupant and asked them to call her husband.
Will Rogers arrived at the scene within a few minutes, and police took the couple to the San Diego Police Department's Northern Division headquarters.
 ""She looked like she'd just been rear-ended or something,"" said Charles Archer, one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first.
""She was surprised and shocked, but she wasn't burned and she wasn't bleeding.""
 San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogerses' home on Sherlock Court, checking two other vehicles and the home with dogs specially trained to sniff for explosives.
Investigators also used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles.
 Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30 a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop.
He returned, drank coffee with his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the vehicle, investigators said.
When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian jetliner.
The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight, but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported prowlers near the vehicle.
He also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog.
 ""The dog didn't bark, and the dog barks at everybody,"" the official said.
 He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no threats since the airplane was downed.
 ""There were no threats, nothing,"" he said.
""That's what's funny.
If you're getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and graffiti, you would worry.
But here there was nothing.""
 Late Friday, the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation, but at a press conference, the FBI's Hughes said, ""An explosive device exploded in the vehicle.""
 However, two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed on the transmission under the van.
 ""If she didn't get out like that . . .
well, she was very, very lucky,"" one source said.
He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was connected under the van's transmission.
He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives were used.
Within hours, San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was caused by a pipe bomb.
Archer said he found a flattened, 2-by-3-inch section of metal pipe near the curb and turned it over to investigators.
 The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego, returned from its six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October.
It remains in port with Rogers as its skipper.
 As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar system.
After the plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers gave the order to fire.
 That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew.
But the aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus A300.
All aboard were killed when the plane was knocked out of the air by a Vincennes missile.
 After the downing of the plane, Iran said it would seek retribution for the deaths of the innocent civilians.
 No Threats 
However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship returned to San Diego.
The Vincennes and Rogers received some ""negative"" mail last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, a spokesman said.
The mail was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not contain threats, the spokesman said.
 Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers has been overseeing routine ship maintenance and training in preparation for its next deployment.
The Navy does not disclose the dates any of its ships will be deployed, but surface ships normally work in 18-month cycles, spending about six months at sea and the remainder of the time at or near their home ports.
 Terrorism experts believe that the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 may have been retribution for the Vincennes' shooting down of the Iranian jetliner.
But no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Pan Am aircraft.
 Also contributing to this report were Times staff writers Anthony Perry, H.G. Reza, Tom Gorman, Jane Fritsch and Patrick McDonnell in San Diego and Ronald J. Ostrow and William Rempel in Los Angeles ","Sharon Rogers, wife of captain Will Rogers III, escaped injury Friday morning when a pipe bomb exploded under her van moments after she left the van.
The vehicle was destroyed.
Mrs. Rogers was dazed but was able to walk away.
Captain Rogers is still the skipper of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes that is now at San Diego following its return from the Persian Gulf.
In July 1988 missiles fired from the Vincennes destroyed an Iranian airliner, killing 290.
The FBI said the bomb was amateurish and shoddy, but did not rule out a connection to a terrorist group.","[[1, 34], [78, 160], [2953, 2957], [3169, 3182], [3989, 4002], [4090, 4111], [4992, 5047], [7961, 8061], [8087, 8132], [433, 440], [450, 458], [484, 501], [8385, 8389], [8467, 8475], [8622, 8639], [665, 670], [897, 901], [951, 954], [973, 988], [1126, 1148], [951, 954], [1089, 1093], [1206, 1228], [1911, 1922]]"
" ""Mad cow disease"" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
 ""I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,"" says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London.
""But they certainly are not zero.
I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder.""
 Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.
The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly.
The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.
The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed.
In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE.
 ""I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation,"" said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.
The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said.
""In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented.""
 As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is budgeting $16 million for 1990.
 Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland.
 Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington.
 Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months.
 David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of ""BSE hysteria"" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is ""remote.""
The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease.
 A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford University, reported last year that the cause of BSE ""is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses.""
The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies.
The Southwood report said it is ""most unlikely"" that the disease poses a threat to humans.
But the report added: ""If our assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect, the implications would be extremely serious.""
 There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last year.
 Another form, known as kuru, had been found in cannibals in New Guinea.
 According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free of scrapie.
 ""It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of BSE on human health,"" a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture Ministry.
The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a ""shrewd guess"" that BSE is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
","Scientists are uncertain of the cause or means of transmission of ""Mad cow disease"" which has killed 10,000 cattle, adversely affecting the market for British beef and raising fears about eating beef.
The British government has taken steps to stop the spread of the disease, while compensating owners for animals destroyed, and assuring the public that there is little chance of risk to human health.
Nevertheless, several countries have imposed an embargo on the export of cattle from Britain.

" ""Junk bond"" wizard Michael Milken officially ended his 20-year career at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Thursday and said he will launch his own financial consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud charges.
 Milken, 42, who has been on a leave of absence from Drexel since March 29, on Thursday submitted his resignation.
In a telephone interview, he said his new firm, International Capital Access Group, would offer a wide range of consulting services consistent with his personal interests and his previous work at Drexel.
He claimed that one purpose of the firm will be to ""address the major issues in society.""
He said he would offer advice on subjects as diverse as the Third World debt crisis, helping unions, employees and minorities obtain ownership stakes in companies and advising financially troubled companies on how to raise new capital.
 'Very Emotional Experience' 
 The timing of Milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a Supreme Court decision last week that cleared the way for Drexel to complete its announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The settlement now is expected to go into effect within the next few weeks.
It requires Drexel to terminate Milken's employment and also avoid any direct or indirect business dealings with him.
 Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, 39, also resigned Thursday from Drexel.
He said through his attorney that he plans to resume practicing law.
Lowell Milken had been a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Irell &amp; Manella before he left in 1978 to help his brother run Drexel's junk bond department.
Michael Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said his client hasn't decided yet where he will practice.
Lowell Milken was also indicted in March on racketeering charges.
 During the rare, on-the-record interview, Michael Milken said of the resignation: ""After spending your whole life working for one company, it's a very emotional experience.""
But in a reference to the investigation and legal problems that have beset him, he added, ""the last few years have been an emotional experience.""
 Milken said he decided to set up his own firm now because ""to continue to help (people he has done business with or offered advice to), I need some vehicle to be able to help.""
 'Naturally Disappointed' Milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at Drexel Harriman, a Philadelphia investment firm that was a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert, while attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
Within a decade, his pioneering use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds had transformed Drexel from a second-tier brokerage firm into one of Wall Street's most powerful investment banking houses.
 In a written statement issued Thursday, Milken said: 
 ""Drexel is the only company I've worked for since graduating from college.
And it's the only one I ever expected to work for.
I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies.""
 Milken currently faces a 98-count federal criminal indictment.
The government is also demanding that he forfeit $1.85 billion under the racketeering charges.
 Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said: ""Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad event.""
He added: ""We wish him well in his new endeavor.""
 Milken was somewhat vague about exactly what the new firm will do or how many people it will employ.
His personal spokesman, Ken Lerer, said it would start out with fewer than 10 employees.
Tentative plans call for it to be based in West Los Angeles, and Lerer said it definitely won't be in the Beverly Hills building that houses Drexel's junk bond department.
Milken, his brother and several other partners own that building.
 Declined to Speculate Milken said he isn't currently talking with any of his former colleagues at Drexel about coming to work for his new firm, but he didn't rule out that possibility.
""I just can't tell you at this time,"" he said.
He also declined to speculate on whether he might try to expand the firm to offer full-scale investment banking services if he should succeed in overcoming the criminal and civil charges facing him.
""The financial world changes all the time,"" he said.
""Exactly what one would be interested in doing in the future I don't know.""
 For the time being, Milken's legal problems probably will prevent him from competing directly with Drexel, individuals involved in the legal cases said.
Were he to branch out beyond consulting to underwriting or trading securities, he might run afoul of federal and state regulators who supervise the registration of securities broker-dealers.
But sources said the potential exists nevertheless for conflicts with Drexel.
 The SEC settlement's ban on Drexel doing business either directly or indirectly with Milken could be interpreted to mean that Drexel can't do business with clients advised by Milken.
Milken's lawyers haven't said yet whether they will challenge that provision of the settlement in court.
If it goes into effect, however, it conceivably could force clients to choose between dealing with Milken or Drexel.
A source close to Milken said: ""I think you'd have to take it on a case-by-case basis.""
 Anreder said: ""We don't anticipate any conflicts.""
 Milken also declined to say if he might refer clients to firms other than Drexel for investment banking services.
""I can't predict what's going to happen in the future,"" he said.
""We'll see what happens and it will depend on each individual situation.""
 Milken, who earned amounts ranging up to $550 million per year at Drexel, over the last year has attempted to help arrange financing for unions and workers seeking to take over troubled companies.
He also has proposed innovative solutions to the Latin American debt problem.
Some observers have viewed this as part of an overall public relations campaign at a time when he is in trouble.
But Lerer insists that these are all genuine interests of Milken's and that he has been involved in these activities for years.
 'More Demands Than Ever' Friends of Milken's have speculated that one reason he decided to start a new firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from Drexel, he has had an unaccustomed amount of time on his hands.
They note that Milken typically would work from 4:30 a.m. until about 6 p.m.
He was used to orchestrating a multitude of deals at once.
In recent weeks, Milken has given speeches to a variety of organizations and worked on his legal defense.
 ""I think Michael is desperate to find something to do,"" a former Drexel colleague said.
 Milken himself, however, strongly denied that he has time on his hands.
""I have more demands on my time than ever before,"" he said, although he added, referring to the legal cases: ""Sometimes they're things you'd rather not have to spend time on.""
 Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, declined to comment Thursday on Milken's decision to open a new business.
The Milken brothers still face SEC civil charges as well as the separate criminal charges.
 Milken, his brother and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg are likely to go to trial on the pending criminal charges sometime early next year.
Federal prosecutors are expected to bring a new indictment within the next several months containing additional charges.
 A number of Milken's former colleagues at Drexel already have been granted immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government investigation.
Sources confirmed Thursday that another former Drexel employee, Reed Harmon, who had worked closely with Milken, was recently granted immunity in exchange for testimony before a grand jury.
 Charges Denied Harmon is said to have detailed knowledge of some of Milken's business dealings with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky.
Boesky, suspected of widespread insider trading, pleaded guilty to one criminal count and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
Much of the government's case against Milken involves his alleged dealings with Boesky.
 Milken, Lowell Milken and Newberg
all vigorously deny the charges against them.
 Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to six criminal charges and pay $650 million in penalties under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan.
The guilty plea would be made after the firm's separate settlement with the SEC goes into effect.
Lawyers for Michael and Lowell Milken are challenging provisions of the settlement agreement, including a requirement that Drexel withhold much of the brothers' compensation owed them for 1988.
Michael Milken is said to be owed at least $200 million.

" Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran.
 Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions.
 Organizers said they hope to raise at least $500,000 in donations.
 ""We'll do this as long as it takes,"" said organizer Bijan Kian.
""We will be back here again next Sunday.
I have been in contact with a group that raised $150,000 (Saturday) by telephoning from home to home.
This is from their friends and relatives.
I'm sure we can double and triple that.""
 The 50 organizers Sunday wore black armbands expressing their grief for those killed, injured and left homeless in what they described as that country's worst earthquake of the century.
 In Iran, rescue efforts were hampered Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet jarred the already severely damaged rice-growing region of Rasht, 120 miles northwest of Tehran.
The new shock, with a magnitude of 5.7, toppled the few still-standing structures and caused mudslides that temporarily closed the road linking Rasht with other destruction zones in Zanjan province.
 Estimates of the number killed in the devastating quake reached 50,000, with an additional 200,000 injured.
 Army mountaineers climbed rugged mountains Sunday in an effort to rescue villagers trapped in remote hamlets in the ravaged northern provinces.
 ""They have no water or electricity,"" said Farrokh Shokooh, another organizer of the Sunday fund-raiser.
""Everything is made that much more difficult because it is the rainy season.""
 Shokooh said the effort to help the earthquake victims was put together hastily Friday afternoon.
 The group set up the collection point in front of William R. Mason Regional Park on property belonging to the City of Irvine.
 Irvine Police Sgt.
Tom Hume, who is in charge of policing special events held in the city, said the group failed to obtain a permit from the city.
But police accommodated the group, blocking off a bike lane on University Avenue so cars could pull in and unload supplies for the earthquake victims.
The supplies were put into a large truck parked along the road.
 Hume said that two officers assigned to the event reported the crowd as small.
 Organizer Genia Panahi, 40, of Newport Beach, said the 150 Iranian doctors practicing in Orange County responded to calls for medicine, surgical gloves, disposable needles and blood bags.
Organizers said between 60,000 and 80,000 Iranians live in Orange County.
 ""Medicine is in such a short supply over there,"" said Panahi, who along with her husband is a medical doctor.
""Doctors are being asked to donate needles, gloves and antibiotics.""
 Her 17-year-old son, Homan, and his friend Sepehr Khonsari worked throughout the day Saturday collecting medical supplies from doctors' offices throughout the county.
 The group -- the Orange County Committee for Iran Earthquake Relief -- has set up a special account at Capital Bank in Santa Ana.
Checks can be made out to the Iran Earthquake Fund and mailed to the bank at 400 N. Tustin Ave.
Blankets, tents and sleeping bags can be delivered to the Iranian Cultural Center at 8361 Westminster Blvd., Suite 220, in Westminster.
 Kian said money sent to the special Capital Bank account will be turned over to the Red Cross for distribution in Iran.
 Red Cross representative Sylvia Stewart said the Red Cross will accept only monetary contributions because shipping supplies there is very expensive.
She said sending money and allowing the supplies to be purchased there ""helps stimulate the economy.""
She said the donations are sent to the national Red Cross and then to the international organization.
 The Iranian Student Assn.
at California State Fullerton has set up a booth in Parking Lot C near State College Boulevard and Nutwood Avenue.
The donations will be forwarded to the Red Cross or they may be sent directly to the Red Cross, P.O. Box 11364, Santa Ana, CA.

","The Iranian community of Orange County, California launched an effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless victims of the earthquake in northwestern Iran.
Between 60,000 and 80,000 Iranians live in Orange County and 150 Iranian doctors practicing there responded to calls for medical supplies.
In Iran rescue efforts suffered a setback Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet with a magnitude of 5.7 hit the rice-growing region of Rasht causing mudslides that temporarily closed off an important relief route.

" Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran.
 Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions.
 Organizers said they hope to raise at least $500,000 in donations.
 ""We'll do this as long as it takes,"" said organizer Bijan Kian.
""We will be back here again next Sunday.
I have been in contact with a group that raised $150,000 (Saturday) by telephoning from home to home.
This is from their friends and relatives.
I'm sure we can double and triple that.""

" Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside.
 Three of the crewmen were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel and a fourth was plucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter.
The Coast Guard also said there were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another boat.
 Rescue divers, however, were unable to search the overturned service vessel for survivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves.
The hope was that at least some of the crew would be in airtight cabins with enough oxygen to survive until help reached them.
But Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead said the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in excess of 60 m.p.h.
and waves were at 12 feet and building.
 Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center in Miami announced that Chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h.
 The 72-foot service vessel, leased to the Chevron Corp. by the Avis Bourg Co., capsized about 25 miles south of Morgan City, La.
It is a self-propelled vessel with legs that can be extended to the ocean floor.
The boat was ordered into port because of the impending storm.
 Late Monday afternoon, Chantal was about 200 miles south-southeast of Galveston, Tex., traveling northwest at about 10 m.p.h.
Officials at the National Hurricane Service in Miami said the storm was expected to reach land some time this afternoon or evening.
The best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the western Louisiana or upper Texas coast.
Hurricane warnings were issued from Freeport, Tex., to Morgan City.
Tropical storm warnings were issued as far south as Port O'Connor, Tex., and as far east as Mobile, Ala. Bob Ebaugh, a weather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was expected in southern Mississippi, Louisiana and East Texas.
 Meanwhile, coastal residents began what has long been a ritual along the Gulf Coast during hurricane season, which begins in late spring and runs through early fall.
Grocery stores began reporting a steady demand for hurricane staples -- bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows.
 One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane.
In that event, the Houston area would have ""extensive flooding,"" said Bill Evans, flood watch director for the Harris County Flood Control District.
 Besides heavy rains and wind, the hurricane is expected to cause tides 5 to 7 feet above normal.
Chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the hurricane season June 1.

" Hurricane Hugo advanced faster and with renewed fury today on Georgia and South Carolina as 150,000 coastal residents grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.
 ""We're not going to take any chances,"" said Lamar Davis, a bartender on St. Simons Island off southern Georgia, who stole a last glance at the pounding surf before leaving with his wife and 4-year-old daughter.
 The leading edge of Hugo, whose winds muscled up to 125 m.p.h.
from 105 m.p.h.
the day before, was most likely to hit between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston any time after 8 p.m., local time.
A hurricane warning was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C. 
At 3 p.m., Hugo was 220 miles from Savannah and bearing down at 20 m.p.h.
It was expected to turn gradually to the north, according to the National Weather Service.
 Tidal Surge Feared The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot tide that peaks after 2 a.m. 
 ""On top of that will be waves, and so (on) . . .
barrier islands (in) many places the buildings will be swept clean off of those islands,"" Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, said from Coral Gables, Fla.
 Evacuees queued up at gasoline stations and stripped store shelves of bottled water, bread and batteries.
Officials warned coastal dwellers not to linger because gale force winds and flash floods could block escape routes.
Five to 10 inches of rain is expected.
 The Navy moved ships out of coastal harbors to ride out the storm at sea.
Army bases in coastal states moved helicopters inland or into shelters.
 In South Carolina, which was in a state of emergency, Gov. Carroll Campbell dispatched 400 National Guardsmen to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront.
About one-fifth of the state's 3.1 million residents live in eight coastal counties.

" The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously.
It would be one of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island.
 Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away.
The musicians were between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school.
 A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb.
But he said the characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared to confirm that it was the work of the IRA.
 Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA ""active service"" units, each composed of four or five members, are operating in Britain and continental Europe.
 One member, known as the ""Jackal"" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth novel ""The Day of the Jackal,"" has been eluding the authorities for two years.
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in August, 1988.
One soldier was killed in that incident.
 Sheehy and another wanted Irishman, John Conaghty, were linked to an IRA bomb factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in pursuit of a car thief.
A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons, ammunition, 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a ""hit list"" of 100 British political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
 Friday's explosion occurred about 8:30 a.m. in a lounge at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent.
At the school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before joining Royal Marines bands.
 The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the rubble.
Firefighters used thermal cameras and dogs to search the debris for victims and survivors.
Heavy lifting gear was brought to the scene from a nearby site where a tunnel is being built beneath the English Channel.
 Rescuers shouted for quiet as they used high-technology listening equipment in an effort to trace the sound of faint heartbeats.
 ""I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,"" Heather Hackett, a 26-year-old Deal housewife, told the British Press Assn.
She said she told her children to run for cover, but as they did, her kitchen window shattered.

 'Appalling Outrage' Defense Secretary Tom King visited the scene and called the bombing ""an appalling outrage committed against unarmed bandsmen -- people who worked for charity, who have given great enjoyment to millions right across the country, right across the world.""

The authorities have been on high alert, expecting IRA attacks in connection with last month's 20th anniversary of the introduction of British troops into Northern Ireland.
The republican underground organization opposes British rule in the predominantly Protestant province and is fighting to join the mainly Roman Catholic south in a united, independent Ireland.
 Visit to Ulster 
 But in a statement telephoned to a Dublin news agency, Ireland International, Friday's attack was linked to Thatcher's visit last week to units of the controversial Ulster Defense Regiment in Northern Ireland.
 The locally recruited, overwhelmingly Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment has come under fire in connection with an investigation into the leak of secret government lists of suspected IRA members to Protestant assassination squads.
It is widely hated by the Catholic minority in the province, and the Irish government in Dublin has urged Britain to disband the force.
 ""Mrs. Thatcher visited Ireland with a message of war at a time when we want peace,"" the statement claiming responsibility for the Deal attack said.
""Now in turn we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent.
But we still want peace, and we want the British government to leave our country.""
The statement was signed ""P. O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau,"" a signature that has appeared on earlier IRA bombing claims.
 Friday's attack was the worst on the mainland since the virtually simultaneous bombings of July, 1982, directed at ceremonial military units in London's Hyde Park and Regent's Park.
Eleven bandsmen and mounted guards were killed in those incidents.
 Eight persons were killed by IRA car bombs outside Harrods department store here in December, 1983, and 21 were killed and 162 injured in two Birmingham public house bombings in the fall of 1974.
 An attempted barracks bombing was averted last February when a sentry came upon two intruders who had managed to get inside a military camp in Shropshire.
 There has been a series of bomb and automatic rifle attacks this year on British soldiers and their families stationed in West Germany.
Earlier this month an IRA gunman shot to death an army wife, Heidi Hazell, 25, in her car near her home at Dortmund.
","A huge explosion yesterday in the lounge of the Royal Marines School of Music killed ten and injured 22, eight seriously.
The School is located in Deal on the English Channel.
Eyewitness accounts of neighbors attest to the strength of the blast.
Investigators said that it was probably a bomb blast, and the IRA has claimed responsibility.
The British think that at least two IRA ""active service"" units, each with four or five members, operate in Britain and continental Europe.
Increased IRA activity had been anticipated because last month marked the 20th anniversary of British troops entering Northern Ireland.","[[54, 70], [168, 218], [1746, 1764], [1781, 1829], [1814, 1820], [1830, 1863], [1, 49], [533, 662], [825, 970], [3624, 3795]]"
" The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously.
It would be one of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island.
 Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away.
The musicians were between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school.
 A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb.
But he said the characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared to confirm that it was the work of the IRA.
 Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA ""active service"" units, each composed of four or five members, are operating in Britain and continental Europe.
 One member, known as the ""Jackal"" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth novel ""The Day of the Jackal,"" has been eluding the authorities for two years.
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in August, 1988.
One soldier was killed in that incident.
 Sheehy and another wanted Irishman, John Conaghty, were linked to an IRA bomb factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in pursuit of a car thief.
A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons, ammunition, 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a ""hit list"" of 100 British political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
 Friday's explosion occurred about 8:30 a.m. in a lounge at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent.
At the school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before joining Royal Marines bands.
 The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the rubble.
Firefighters used thermal cameras and dogs to search the debris for victims and survivors.
Heavy lifting gear was brought to the scene from a nearby site where a tunnel is being built beneath the English Channel.
 Rescuers shouted for quiet as they used high-technology listening equipment in an effort to trace the sound of faint heartbeats.
 ""I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,"" Heather Hackett, a 26-year-old Deal housewife, told the British Press Assn.
She said she told her children to run for cover, but as they did, her kitchen window shattered.
 ""The whole window was blown across the kitchen,"" Hackett recalled.
Her 2-year-old son, Joshua, was hit by a shard that embedded itself in his back but caused no serious injury.
 ""I just screamed and ran out of the room,"" she said.
""The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in.""

" Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.
He was 72.
 Bernstein, known and beloved by the world as ""Lenny,"" died at 6:15 p.m. in the presence of his son, Alexander, and physician, Kevin M. Cahill, who said the cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure.
On Cahill's advice, the conductor had announced Tuesday that he would retire.
Cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working.
In recent months, Bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency.
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood, Mass., on Aug. 19.
 Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano.
He etched other niches in history by composing the indelible ""West Side Story"" and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television series ""Omnibus.""
 Exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one, Bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life.
With it, he became a personality, well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show.
 The dervish persona, including his upstart gymnastics on the podium, never lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight.
 He made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses.
And he lifted popular music to a higher plane, infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound.
 ""Some conductors mellow with age,"" commented Times music critic Martin Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 1986.
""(But) Bernstein, at 68, remains a frenetic combination of orbiting rocket, aerobics master, super-juggler, matinee idol, booming cannon, hysterical mime, heart-rending tragedian, bouncing ball, sky writer, riveting machine, mawkish sentimentalist and danseur ignoble.""
 Describing the conductor in the same concert, Bernheimer referred to him as ""the shrugging, jumping, sighing, soaring, gushing, crouching, rocking, rolling, bounding, bobbing, leaping, jiggling, stabbing, hunching, bumping, grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis.""
 Critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and often-criticized showmanship masked lazy, sloppy or inept musicianship, Bernstein could never have remained an internationally sought-after conductor for five decades.
He knew what he was doing, and the musicians he accompanied, wrote for, conducted, or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own.
 Louis Bernstein (so-named because his maternal grandmother insisted)
was born Aug. 25, 1918, in Lawrence, Mass., to two Russian Jewish immigrants.
His father, Samuel Joseph Bernstein, was an entrepreneur of women's hair care products and a Talmudic scholar.
His mother, Jennie Resnick Bernstein, who survives him, said her son always had an ear for music.
""When he was 4 or 5, he would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill.""
The parents preferred the name ""Leonard"" and called the boy that.
When his kindergarten teacher asked ""Louis Bernstein"" to stand up, he remained seated and looked around the room to see who shared his last name.
Bernstein changed his name legally at age 16, when he got his first driver's license.
 His mega musical talent emerged belatedly and almost by accident.
 When Bernstein was 10, a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his parents, and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with it.
He asked for lessons, and soon was playing better than his teacher, a neighbor's daughter who charged $1 a lesson.
By age 12, he was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and had determined, despite his father's objections, that music -- at that point playing the piano -- would be his career.
 Bernstein's stunning instinctive talents for sight-reading, remembering complicated scores, and improvisation became evident as he played, and altered, classical, jazz and popular music.
He produced his own shows and versions of ""The Mikado"" and ""Carmen,"" and performed as piano soloist with his school orchestra and the State Symphony Orchestra.
 He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School.
 At Harvard University, Bernstein studied piano and composition, but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron Copland.
 A fan and practitioner of his music, Bernstein met Copland in a typical it-could-only-happen-to-Lenny incident.
Invited to a dance recital in New York, Bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize.
Invited afterward to a post-recital birthday party for Copland, Bernstein commandeered the piano and played Copland's ""Piano Variations.""
His performance captivated the man he had met in the balcony, who of course was Copland.
 They became lifelong friends.
Copland introduced Bernstein to several composers and got him his first job -- transcribing music for the publisher Boosey and Hawkes.
Ironically, Copland subsequently urged the torn Bernstein to make conducting, rather than composing or even piano playing, his career.
 Conducting emerged as a possibility to Bernstein that same year -- 1937, his sophomore year at Harvard -- when he met the Greek conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus.
Mitropoulos was so impressed with Bernstein's playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the Boston Symphony.
The maestro also talked with Bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts, promising to keep in touch.
 ""The influence of Mitropoulos on my life, on my conducting life is enormous and usually greatly underrated or not known at all,"" Bernstein wrote years later, after his mentors had all died, ""because ordinarily the two great conductors with whom I studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting prowess I have, namely Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner. . . .
But long before I met either of them, I had met Dimitri Mitropoulos . . .
and watching him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the Boston Symphony laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which I wasn't even aware of until many years later.""
 Graduated from Harvard and out of work after a summer in New York, Bernstein asked Mitropoulos what he should do.
 ""You must be a conductor,"" Mitropoulos replied, urging him to study at Juilliard or with Reiner at Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.
It was fall and conducting classes at Juilliard were full, so Bernstein went to Philadelphia for two years.
 During the summers he studied under Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony, at the new school Koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer home, Tanglewood.
 ""He became like a surrogate father to me,"" Bernstein later said of Koussevitzky, his third major conducting mentor.
""He had no children of his own and I had a father whom I loved very much but who was not for this musical thing at all. . . .
And so I found another father: first Mitropoulos, then Reiner, and now Koussevitzky.
But the Koussevitzky relationship was very special, very warm.""
 Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's assistant and returned to Tanglewood annually to conduct and teach.
He so revered the maestro that he was married in Koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links.
It was Koussevitzky -- and fate -- who arranged Bernstein's meteoric ascension to world-class conductor at the unheard-of age of 25.
 On his 25th birthday, Aug. 25, 1943, Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky, newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic, at his Stockbridge, Conn., farm.
 ""I am going to need an assistant conductor,"" Rodzinsky told him.
""I have gone through all the conductors I know of in my mind and I finally asked God whom I shall take and God said, 'Take Bernstein,' "" he said, granting the position as a favor not to God but to Koussevitzky.
 Remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an American and so young, Bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium.
In the orchestra's history, no assistant conductor had ever been called on.
 But for ""Lucky Lenny"" history made an exception.
 On Nov. 14, less than three months after Bernstein got the job, guest conductor Bruno Walter fell ill and Rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm.
 Jennie Tourel had sung Bernstein's ""I Hate Music"" at her Town Hall debut the previous night, in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town, and he had played for her and the post-recital party.
 With no rehearsal, a hangover and three hours sleep, Bernstein was to conduct a complex program broadcast nationwide on CBS radio.
 The New York Times chronicled the epic event on Page One and stated in an editorial: ""Mr. Bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full use of his opportunity. . . .
It's a good American success story.
The warm, friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread over the airwaves.""
 Bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the New York Philharmonic in 1957-58.
He had no time for one.
He was too much in demand around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor.
 Successful as a pianist, composer and conductor, Bernstein, according to Joan Peyser in a controversial biography, consulted psychiatrists because of his internal conflict over the three pursuits.
 ""It is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various activities,"" Bernstein wrote in 1946.
""What seems right for me at any given moment is what I must do. . . .
The ends are music itself . . .
and the means are my private problem.""
 The piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime.
Bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and commercializing his conducting career.
 His first major composition, a symphony titled ""Jeremiah,"" was introduced in 1942, and his first ballet, ""Fancy Free,"" and related first musical, ""On the Town,"" both debuted in 1944.
 He sought to be a classical composer, winning plaudits for symphonies (""Jeremiah"" was followed by ""The Age of Anxiety"" in 1949 and ""Kaddish"" in 1963), sonatas, and the operas ""Trouble in Tahiti"" in 1953 and ""A Quiet Place"" in 1983.
 In writing music, Bernstein achieved greater success on Broadway, and even in Hollywood, than in Lincoln Center.
He followed ""On the Town"" with the musicals ""Wonderful Town"" in 1953, the score for the film ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954, and the critically acclaimed but less popular ""Candide"" in 1956.
His best and best-remembered work, ""West Side Story,"" debuted in 1957.
 ""If I can write one real, moving American opera that any American can understand (and one that is, notwithstanding, a serious musical work), I shall be a happy man,"" Bernstein said in 1948.
 When many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with ""West Side Story,"" he disagreed, saying: ""There are moments when I think so, but as a sum total it fails to be an opera.
Because at the denouement, at the dramatic unraveling, the music stops.""
 ""But I don't love it any less,"" he added, reveling in the adulation his adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet conflict had produced.
""It doesn't make it a stepchild or a foundling.""
 In teaching, his fourth area of expertise, Bernstein taught regularly at Tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures on tonality at Harvard in 1973.
It was on television in the 1950s and 1960s, with his ""Young People's Concerts"" of the Philharmonic and ""Omnibus,"" that Bernstein taught the nation.
 ""An assessment of Bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music, a role that has set him apart most from other performers,"" conductor, historian and Bard College President Leon Botstein wrote in Harper's in 1983.
 Instinctively adept at television, Bernstein became a prototype for Carl Sagan, Alistair Cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the Public Broadcasting System.
 Bernstein's programs, Botstein said, ""displayed his gift for analyzing and enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score, its complexity, or its simple genius.
No one before or since Bernstein has been so effective -- artistically and commercially -- in proselytizing and bringing alive serious music to a mass audience.""
 The television classics won Bernstein a coveted Peabody award.
 Bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that had made him wealthy to the struggling New York Philharmonic.
He introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television, widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance.
 He left the orchestra in 1969, after a record 11-year tenure at the helm, to have more time for composing and guest conducting.
If two rings of the Bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music, the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life.
Known for his emotional embraces of both sexes, Bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with him throughout the night at his Manhattan apartment or Connecticut country home.
 A heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon, he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people.
 ""God knows, I should be dead by now,"" he said as he approached 70, characteristically cavalier about his health.
""I smoke.
I drink.
I stay up all night.
I'm overcommitted on all fronts. . . .
I was told that if I didn't stop smoking I'd be dead at 35.
Well, I beat the rap.""
 Raising the high-brow music world's eyebrows, Bernstein campaigned with other celebrities for the civil rights of blacks in the 1960s and against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
Criticized for ""radical chic,"" his leftist political philosophy prompted him to host a storied fund-raising party for the Black Panthers in 1970.
In 1989, he rejected a National Medal of the Arts in protest of the withdrawn $10,000 grant (later reinstated) of the National Endowment for the Arts to an art show on AIDS.
Although Peyser made a strong case in her 1987 biography that Bernstein had many homosexual affairs (Bernstein promised his children never to read the book), there was no question that he adored his family.
On Sept. 9, 1951, he married Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, and, despite a short separation and subsequent reconciliation in 1976, remained devoted to her and went into a severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 1978.
 Bernstein is also survived by two daughters, Jamie and Nina, as well as his sister, Shirley, and brother, Burton.
 Spokeswoman Margaret Carson said the funeral would be private.
 Staunchly opposed to retiring, until last Tuesday, Bernstein continued his guest conducting, composing, and recording, perhaps topping his more than 200 records with the best of his best, a re-recording of ""West Side Story"" in 1985.
The effort became Deutsche Grammaphon's all-time best-selling record and prompted Will Crutchfield to write in the New York Times that Bernstein was in a class with Giuseppe Verdi.
 French President Francois Mitterrand saluted ""West Side Story"" anew in 1986 when he made Bernstein a commander of the Legion of Honor.
 After a nationwide series of concerts and parties celebrating his 70th birthday in 1988, Bernstein said with uncharacteristic modesty: ""I have no further requests of the fates . . .
except for time.
I've achieved more than I had any right to expect.
Nobody has been as lucky as I have.""
 SUPERSTAR LENNY:
Too much talent, too little time, says Martin Bernheimer.
A23 ","Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man, died Sunday at 72 from lung disease.
He had remarkable talent and expertise in conducting, composing, playing the piano, and teaching, which he combined with a unique theatrical flair in both his professional and private lives.

He was mentored by the great musicians of the era.

 ""The influence of Mitropoulos on my life, on my conducting life is enormous and usually greatly underrated or not known at all,"" Bernstein wrote years later, after his mentors had all died, ""because ordinarily the two great conductors with whom I studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting prowess I have, namely Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner. . . .
But long before I met either of them, I had met Dimitri Mitropoulos . . .
and watching him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the Boston Symphony laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which I wasn't even aware of until many years later.""
 Graduated from Harvard and out of work after a summer in New York, Bernstein asked Mitropoulos what he should do.
 ""You must be a conductor,"" Mitropoulos replied, urging him to study at Juilliard or with Reiner at Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.
It was fall and conducting classes at Juilliard were full, so Bernstein went to Philadelphia for two years.
 During the summers he studied under Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony, at the new school Koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer home, Tanglewood.
 ""He became like a surrogate father to me,"" Bernstein later said of Koussevitzky, his third major conducting mentor.
""He had no children of his own and I had a father whom I loved very much but who was not for this musical thing at all. . . .
And so I found another father: first Mitropoulos, then Reiner, and now Koussevitzky.
But the Koussevitzky relationship was very special, very warm.""
 Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's assistant and returned to Tanglewood annually to conduct and teach.
He so revered the maestro that he was married in Koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links.
It was Koussevitzky -- and fate -- who arranged Bernstein's meteoric ascension to world-class conductor at the unheard-of age of 25.
 On his 25th birthday, Aug. 25, 1943, Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky, newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic, at his Stockbridge, Conn., farm.
 ""I am going to need an assistant conductor,"" Rodzinsky told him.
""I have gone through all the conductors I know of in my mind and I finally asked God whom I shall take and God said, 'Take Bernstein,' "" he said, granting the position as a favor not to God but to Koussevitzky.
 Remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an American and so young, Bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium.
In the orchestra's history, no assistant conductor had ever been called on.
 But for ""Lucky Lenny"" history made an exception.
 On Nov. 14, less than three months after Bernstein got the job, guest conductor Bruno Walter fell ill and Rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm.
 Jennie Tourel had sung Bernstein's ""I Hate Music"" at her Town Hall debut the previous night, in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town, and he had played for her and the post-recital party.
 With no rehearsal, a hangover and three hours sleep, Bernstein was to conduct a complex program broadcast nationwide on CBS radio.
 The New York Times chronicled the epic event on Page One and stated in an editorial: ""Mr. Bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full use of his opportunity. . . .
It's a good American success story.
The warm, friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread over the airwaves.""
 Bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the New York Philharmonic in 1957-58.
He had no time for one.
He was too much in demand around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor.
 Successful as a pianist, composer and conductor, Bernstein, according to Joan Peyser in a controversial biography, consulted psychiatrists because of his internal conflict over the three pursuits.
 ""It is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various activities,"" Bernstein wrote in 1946.
""What seems right for me at any given moment is what I must do. . . .
The ends are music itself . . .
and the means are my private problem.""
 The piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime.
Bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and commercializing his conducting career.
 His first major composition, a symphony titled ""Jeremiah,"" was introduced in 1942, and his first ballet, ""Fancy Free,"" and related first musical, ""On the Town,"" both debuted in 1944.
 He sought to be a classical composer, winning plaudits for symphonies (""Jeremiah"" was followed by ""The Age of Anxiety"" in 1949 and ""Kaddish"" in 1963), sonatas, and the operas ""Trouble in Tahiti"" in 1953 and ""A Quiet Place"" in 1983.
 In writing music, Bernstein achieved greater success on Broadway, and even in Hollywood, than in Lincoln Center.
He followed ""On the Town"" with the musicals ""Wonderful Town"" in 1953, the score for the film ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954, and the critically acclaimed but less popular ""Candide"" in 1956.
His best and best-remembered work, ""West Side Story,"" debuted in 1957.
 ""If I can write one real, moving American opera that any American can understand (and one that is, notwithstanding, a serious musical work), I shall be a happy man,"" Bernstein said in 1948.
 When many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with ""West Side Story,"" he disagreed, saying: ""There are moments when I think so, but as a sum total it fails to be an opera.
Because at the denouement, at the dramatic unraveling, the music stops.""
 ""But I don't love it any less,"" he added, reveling in the adulation his adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet conflict had produced.
""It doesn't make it a stepchild or a foundling.""
 In teaching, his fourth area of expertise, Bernstein taught regularly at Tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures on tonality at Harvard in 1973.
It was on television in the 1950s and 1960s, with his ""Young People's Concerts"" of the Philharmonic and ""Omnibus,"" that Bernstein taught the nation.
 ""An assessment of Bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music, a role that has set him apart most from other performers,"" conductor, historian and Bard College President Leon Botstein wrote in Harper's in 1983.
 Instinctively adept at television, Bernstein became a prototype for Carl Sagan, Alistair Cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the Public Broadcasting System.
 Bernstein's programs, Botstein said, ""displayed his gift for analyzing and enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score, its complexity, or its simple genius.
No one before or since Bernstein has been so effective -- artistically and commercially -- in proselytizing and bringing alive serious music to a mass audience.""
 The television classics won Bernstein a coveted Peabody award.
 Bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that had made him wealthy to the struggling New York Philharmonic.
He introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television, widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance.
 He left the orchestra in 1969, after a record 11-year tenure at the helm, to have more time for composing and guest conducting.
If two rings of the Bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music, the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life.
Known for his emotional embraces of both sexes, Bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with him throughout the night at his Manhattan apartment or Connecticut country home.
 A heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon, he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people.
 ""God knows, I should be dead by now,"" he said as he approached 70, characteristically cavalier about his health.
""I smoke.
I drink.
I stay up all night.
I'm overcommitted on all fronts. . . .
I was told that if I didn't stop smoking I'd be dead at 35.
Well, I beat the rap.""
 Raising the high-brow music world's eyebrows, Bernstein campaigned with other celebrities for the civil rights of blacks in the 1960s and against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
Criticized for ""radical chic,"" his leftist political philosophy prompted him to host a storied fund-raising party for the Black Panthers in 1970.
In 1989, he rejected a National Medal of the Arts in protest of the withdrawn $10,000 grant (later reinstated) of the National Endowment for the Arts to an art show on AIDS.
Although Peyser made a strong case in her 1987 biography that Bernstein had many homosexual affairs (Bernstein promised his children never to read the book), there was no question that he adored his family.
On Sept. 9, 1951, he married Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, and, despite a short separation and subsequent reconciliation in 1976, remained devoted to her and went into a severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 1978.
 Bernstein is also survived by two daughters, Jamie and Nina, as well as his sister, Shirley, and brother, Burton.
 Spokeswoman Margaret Carson said the funeral would be private.
 Staunchly opposed to retiring, until last Tuesday, Bernstein continued his guest conducting, composing, and recording, perhaps topping his more than 200 records with the best of his best, a re-recording of ""West Side Story"" in 1985.
The effort became Deutsche Grammaphon's all-time best-selling record and prompted Will Crutchfield to write in the New York Times that Bernstein was in a class with Giuseppe Verdi.
 French President Francois Mitterrand saluted ""West Side Story"" anew in 1986 when he made Bernstein a commander of the Legion of Honor.
 After a nationwide series of concerts and parties celebrating his 70th birthday in 1988, Bernstein said with uncharacteristic modesty: ""I have no further requests of the fates . . .
except for time.
I've achieved more than I had any right to expect.
Nobody has been as lucky as I have.""
 SUPERSTAR LENNY:
Too much talent, too little time, says Martin Bernheimer.
A23 ","Leonard Bernstein, the flamboyant Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.
He was 72 and had suffered from progressive lung failure.
Mr. Bernstein, the internationally acclaimed conductor of the New York Philharmonic from 1957 until 1968, was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra.
Harvard educated and mentored by several musical giants, including Aaron Copeland, he brought classical music to the masses via his innovative television series ""Omnibus,"" and made an indelible mark on American popular music with his composition, ""West Side Story.""","[[1, 105], [124, 138], [177, 215], [217, 226], [385, 445], [818, 900], [7959, 7980], [9344, 9357], [9616, 9659], [4708, 4718], [4731, 4740], [4855, 4868], [4871, 4872], [4881, 4906], [5378, 5395], [5739, 5774], [6213, 6224], [6387, 6425], [1085, 1174], [842, 850], [1002, 1011], [1018, 1080], [1798, 1811]]"
" Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years.
 The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989.
A 6.5-magnitude quake was centered there in 1865.
 The U.S. Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018.
The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake.
 A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as much.
 Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as ""preshocks"" of the Tuesday's 6.9 temblor.
He said ""foreshocks"" would not be the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck.
 Heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely.
But he joined Caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months.
A 5.9 aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area.
 After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Geological Survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, within the next few days in the vicinity.
 But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity.
The trouble was, the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault.
Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area.
 The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea.
It has been the site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded history.
Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 magnitude, it should be considered only a ""strong"" shock, not a ""major"" one, as a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a ""great"" one, as a quake of 8.0 or above would be.
 Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades.
But, as it was, Tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than the 1987 Whittier quake.
Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase in the power of an earthquake.
 Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another.
But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological Survey's Menlo Park office.
 Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from the epicenter.
 Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake.
 The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point.
 Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas.
But when a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake scientists expressed concern that this could be the case.
 Between the late 1950s and 1979, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger near the Bay Area.
But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose, and since then there have been a number of quakes.
In August, Geological Survey scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 5-magnitude quakes south of the Bay Area.
They noted that a similar series of moderately strong quakes had preceded the San Francisco quake of 1906.
 Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about Oct. 16.
 Iben Browning, of Sandia Park, N. M., said he had based his prediction on an assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the Earth.
He said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that publicity about it would cause people to panic.

 I opened the door to the trailer and looked out.
The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was designed to do.
It was opening and closing as if the place was made of cardboard instead of concrete.
 A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
 I walked into the stadium to interview fans.
And again, I sensed little panic.
 Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed.

And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget.
 I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.
It was shortly after the network went on the air.
My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening.
 To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time.
 I opened the door to the trailer and looked out.
The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was designed to do.
It was opening and closing as if the place was made of cardboard instead of concrete.
 A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
 I walked into the stadium to interview fans.
And again, I sensed little panic.
 Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed.
 And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked to varied.
Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more shaken than those in the lower levels.
LARRY STEWART ","A reporter at Candlestick Park Tuesday night when the earthquake hit first thought a low- flying jet had passed overhead.
The stadium shook and the special concrete joints strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage did what they were designed to, opening and closing as if the stadium was cardboard instead of concrete.
There was no great alarm or panic because the quake didn't last long.
Those on upper levels seemed more shaken than those on lower.
A few people ran out of the stadium, but most waited in their seats to hear if Game Three of the World Series would be postponed.","[[150, 183], [235, 240], [259, 278], [308, 331], [383, 430], [440, 448], [652, 843], [852, 929], [982, 1055], [1114, 1135], [1316, 1363], [1377, 1419], [932, 976], [188, 214], [1138, 1142], [1150, 1224]]"
" The mysterious geologic forces behind the current eruptions of Mt. Kilauea are quietly creating the newest piece of America.
 Climbing with agonizing slowness from the warm tropical waters just southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii is an undersea mountain named Loihi.
Volcanologists believe Loihi eventually could emerge as the ninth Hawaiian island.
 ""Loihi has grown about 10,100 feet from the Pacific floor,"" Thomas L. Wright, scientist-in-charge of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said.
""It seems to be tapping the same source of magma (lava still underground) as Kilauea.
Loihi needs about 3,100 more feet to break the surface.""
 The observatory, on the rim of Kilauea's summit caldera, or lava lake, is operated by the U.S. Geological Survey.
 Volcanoes have been creating and modifying the environment over eons of geologic time.
More than 80% of Earth's surface is of volcanic origin.
Volcanic eruptions have formed fertile soils and sculpted mountains, plateaus and other majestic landscapes.
Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents helped to form the early atmosphere and oceans where scientists believe life first emerged.
 The volcanic machine powering Kilauea and building Loihi may represent the most visible and most persistent example of this little-known facet of volcanoes.
 Kilauea has been in the news time and again since it resumed erupting on Jan. 3, 1983.
Lava oozing at the rate of 635,000 cubic feet each day has traveled 20 miles east to the Pacific Ocean.
 Lava flowing from the eruption, 50 feet thick in some places, already has torched 140 houses and caused more than $60 million in damage.
Last May 5, a 2,000-foot-wide flow cut off an entire village on the island's southeast coast, and Gov. John D. Waihee declared the town a disaster area.
 These highly publicized lava flows, and those silently lifting Loihi toward the surface, result from the peculiar form of volcanic activity occurring in Hawaii.
 Most of the 500 active surface volcanoes on Earth straddle the margins of continents and the huge plates of rock that fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to make up the planet's surface.
 There are about a dozen of these plates, each of which is about 50 miles thick.
The plates move relative to each other a few inches a year.
Active volcanoes tend to occur in zones of under-thrusting, or ""subduction,"" where one plate is slipping beneath another.
 How can volcanic activity occur in the Hawaiian Islands, which are more than 2,000 miles from the nearest plate margin?
 Hawaiian volcanoes are believed to result from a different phenomenon termed ""hot spot"" volcanism.
Geologists theorize that deep under the Pacific plate is an exquisitely hot, stationary region termed the ""Hawaiian hot spot.""
 Like a propane torch placed under a moving sheet of plastic, the hot spot melts rock in the overriding Pacific plate.
The molten rock, or magma, is less dense than surrounding solid rock and rises through fractures to spill onto the surface or ocean floor.
Over about 70 million years, the continuous movement of the Pacific plate over this stationary ""fountain of fire"" left a trail of more than 80 big volcanoes over the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
Called the Hawaiian Ridge-Emperor Seamount Chain, the islands and undersea mountains, or seamounts, stretch northwestward about 4,000 miles, from the Big Island of Hawaii to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Soviet territory.
 The five main Hawaiian islands are the tops of volcanic mountains that were formed as the Pacific plate moved over the Hawaiian hot spot.
 A scientific record of the plate's movement to the northwest is evident in the age of solidified lava left on each of the islands.
The age decreases from northwest to southeast.
Kauai, in the extreme northwest, is 5.6 million years old; Oahu is 3.4 million; Molokai is 1.8 million, Maui is 800,000, Hawaii is under 700,000 years old.
Lava ages even decrease in the same northwest-to-southeast fashion on each individual island.
 Continued movement of the Pacific plate promises to give the goddess Pele a new home and Hawaii a new island.
If theories about hot spot volcanism are correct, plate movement eventually will carry the Big Island off the Hawaiian hot spot.
The two active volcanoes on the island, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, will become extinct.
The hot spot then will pour molten rock onto the surface through the next volcano in the Hawaiian chain.
 Experts do not know exactly when Loihi will emerge as a new island.
Assuming Loihi's growth continues at current rates, it could take from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years.
But other fates also may await the infant volcano.
 Infusions of molten rock from the hot spot, for instance, may cease unexpectedly.
Loihi's growth would be stunted, leaving it just another seamount in the chain.
The ninth Hawaiian island thus may form in an entirely different place.
 There is also the possibility a sudden major undersea eruption could raise Loihi to the surface sooner than anyone expects.
","An undersea mountain named Loihi, SE of the Big Island of Hawaii, has grown 10,100 feet from the Pacific floor and needs 3,100 more feet to emerge as the ninth Hawaiian island.
The five main islands are tops of volcanic mountains, formed when the Pacific Plate moved over the ""Hawaiian hot spot"".
Their ages are: Kauai, 5.6 million years; Oahu, 3.4 million years; Molokai, 1.8 million years; Maui, 800,000 years.
Hawaii is under 700,000.
Its two active volcanoes are Kilauea and Mauna Loa.
Loihi seems to be tapping the same source of magma as Kilauea, which resumed erupting Jan 3, 1983.","[[195, 232], [236, 268], [361, 370], [377, 411], [316, 351], [581, 592], [599, 617], [3418, 3452], [3457, 3483], [3494, 3554], [3688, 3695], [3735, 3740], [3771, 3788], [3815, 3837], [3839, 3854], [3794, 3813], [3856, 3879], [4225, 4249], [4265, 4286], [355, 360], [496, 543], [569, 579], [1295, 1311], [1348, 1380]]"
" John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
 Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.

Major, 47, her chancellor of the Exchequer, is the youngest person to be elected Britain's prime minister since the 19th Century.
 ""It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,"" Major said.
 He called Thatcher ""a very great prime minister indeed.""
 Thatcher has made no public comment on what she will do next.
She could continue to represent Finchley in the House of Commons, enter the House of Lords, write her memoirs or enter business.
 ""Our job now I think is quite clear.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely and we're going to win the next general election,"" said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St. 
 Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.
 ""I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of our party,"" Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced.
 Hurd also quickly conceded.
Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required and that Major was elected.
 Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing Street to congratulate Major, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is her next-door neighbor at No. 11.
 Queen Elizabeth II will send for Major and ask him to form a Cabinet after Thatcher has handed in her seals of office at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday morning.
 Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the Exchequer last year.
He attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted that Major's own views are more liberal than many supposed.
He described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues.

" A lobbyist for former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. said Friday that moments after he first met Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) at a political event in 1984, the senator suggested Keating should contribute to his campaign.
 James Grogan also told the Senate Ethics Committee he remembers more than one occasion on which Cranston or his aides sought contributions from Keating while at the same time promising to assist Lincoln in its battle against federal regulators.
 Cranston has acknowledged only one such conversation.
 Grogan, a surprise witness who testified under a limited grant of immunity from prosecution, said there was never a trade-off between Keating's contributions and his request for assistance.
But he appeared to strengthen the committee's case against both Cranston and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.).
He provided important new details of Cranston's close alliance with Keating and contradicted earlier testimony by Cranston aides Joy Jacobson and Carolyn D. Jordan.
The panel is investigating charges that Cranston, Riegle and three others -- Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- improperly assisted Keating in exchange for contributions.
Their intervention with federal regulators allegedly delayed the government takeover of Lincoln, contributing to losses of $2 billion by the federally insured thrift.
 Grogan, 36, who was paid $300,000 a year to lobby for Lincoln, recalled that he introduced himself to Cranston at an event in 1984, explaining that he worked for an Arizona builder who had just purchased a savings and loan in California.
He said Cranston promptly pulled a 3x5 card from his pocket, saying: ""I've been very good to the savings and loans.
I've worked hard for California savings and loans.
You all should really support me.""
 Cranston then wrote Grogan's name and telephone number on the card, he said.
 A short time later, according to Grogan, he received a telephone call from Jacobson, the senator's fund-raiser.
He said she repeated Cranston's contention that he had been ""very supportive"" of California thrifts and asked him if Keating would raise money for the senator.
 Grogan indicated he was surprised by this aggressive appeal for money because Keating is a conservative Republican who opposes abortion, and Cranston is a liberal Democrat who is an abortion rights advocate.
As a result, he said, he did not immediately commit Keating to anything during his first conversation with Jacobson.
He said he later persuaded Keating to assist Cranston by telling him that the senator shared his negative opinion of then-Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray.
Keating disagreed with Gray's policies and later accused the bank board chairman of carrying on a ""vendetta"" against Lincoln.
In April, 1985, as a result of Cranston's appeal for funds, Keating collected $15,000 in checks from his employees for the California senator.
It was the first of nearly $1 million that Cranston solicited from Keating -- $60,000 for his campaigns, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party and $850,000 for voter registration groups founded by the senator.
At the same time, Grogan emphasized that Keating did not always have Cranston's support for his proposals.
He said contributions could buy him access to a senator, but the money provided no guarantee that the senator would do the bidding of a contributor.
 ""For example,"" he told the committee, ""Sen. Cranston, whom I believe we gave the most money to, there were several times specifically when I went to his office and asked him, on behalf of Mr. Keating, to take action.
And he said, 'No, I can't do it.'
And this was after tremendous amounts of money had been raised for him.""
 Grogan contradicted earlier testimony by Jacobson, who said that she -- not Cranston -- was approached at the 1984 Democratic National Convention by Grogan, who ""offered to be helpful to the reelection campaign.""
He said that Keating, who eventually developed a warm friendship with Cranston, usually waited until the end of his meetings with the senator to discuss contributions.
 As Grogan explained it: ""Normally as we were leaving, either Mr. Keating would say, 'Is there any way I can help you, senator?
I appreciate our relationship.'
Or at times, Sen. Cranston would say, 'Could you help in this area, could you help raise money here, could you do that?' ""
 He added: ""There was never an occasion where Mr. Keating asked Sen. Cranston to do something, and Sen. Cranston said, 'Only if you raise funds for me.'
There was never an occasion where Mr. Keating said, 'If you do this for me, I will raise X-amount of dollars for you.' ""
 Under questioning by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, Grogan detailed the following occasions on which he said Cranston or his aides allegedly sought contributions while at the same time pledging to assist Keating with regulators: 
 --
In late 1986, when the Senate was considering legislation that would have imposed restraints on Keating's management of Lincoln, Grogan tried to contact Jordan, Cranston's aide on the Banking Committee, for assistance in battling the proposal.
Unable to reach Jordan, he instead talked to Jacobson.
 When Jacobson called back an hour later to report that she had told Jordan of Keating's opposition, she then said she wanted to ""switch gears"" and discuss something ""totally unrelated.""
She asked him whether Cranston could get a personal loan for his reelection campaign from Lincoln.
 As a result, Cranston's campaign subsequently received a $300,000 line of credit from Lincoln that he never used.
 --
In September, 1987, Grogan personally delivered two checks totaling $250,000 for voter registration to Cranston in his office in the Capitol.
""Mr. Keating wanted me to give you those checks,"" he told the senator.
 Grogan and Cranston then discussed Lincoln's problems, with Keating joining the conversation over the office speaker phone.
Keating asked Cranston to contact then-bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall on Lincoln's behalf, and the senator agreed.
 --
In January, 1988, Grogan, Keating, Cranston, Cranston's son, Kim, and Kim's then-girlfriend, actress Shelley Duvall, had dinner together at Jimmy's restaurant in Los Angeles.
Kim explained the work of Cranston's voter registration groups, one of which he headed, and Cranston offered to make two telephone calls suggested by Keating.
In one call, Cranston arranged a meeting for Keating with Wall.
 Cranston has previously acknowledged that both contributions and assistance for Lincoln were discussed at the dinner.
Grogan could not remember any discussion of specific amounts of money that Keating would contribute to the voter registration effort.
 Grogan contradicted testimony by Jordan concerning a written statement she inserted into the Congressional Record on Cranston's behalf in 1987 that assisted Lincoln in a pending court suit against the bank board.
Jordan told the committee she acted entirely on her own initiative, but Grogan said she was acting on his request.
 Grogan also contradicted Riegle's statement that he did not arrange meetings between the five senators and federal regulators in early April, 1987.
These meetings have been a central focus of the so-called Keating Five case because the regulators alleged that they were asked improperly by the senators to go easy on Lincoln.
He said it was during Riegle's visit to Keating's headquarters in Phoenix in March, 1987, that the senator first proposed the idea of such meetings.
He said he later learned that Riegle had contacted Gray, who consented to meet with the senators.
 Grogan said Riegle, who was in line to become chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, had also insisted he himself could not attend such a meeting with the regulators unless he was invited by McCain and DeConcini, who represented the state where Keating lived.
 ""It was apparent to me . . .
Sen. Riegle knew as a true politician that this was a potential politically explosive situation because there was so much media at the time about Mr. Keating and Mr. Gray fighting,"" he said.
","Charles Keating was a shrewd observer of people, especially people who could help him in building and protecting his financial empire.
Keating's political beliefs were not a consideration when seeking political influence.
This became evident during the course of Keating's battles against officials who were attempting to put restrictions on the savings and loan industry.
On one occasion, Keating used the influence he had as a heavy contributor to arrange a meeting with five senators, four of whom were Democrats and one a Republican.
Keating, a conservative Republican, had little in common with the four Democrats in the group.","[[56, 63], [67, 74], [3991, 3998], [4004, 4042], [4058, 4102], [4120, 4144], [4172, 4428], [891, 929], [2276, 2301], [2339, 2360], [891, 929], [1179, 1404], [123, 152], [817, 852], [1096, 1236], [6462, 6492], [7147, 7189], [7293, 7305], [7381, 7389], [7453, 7460], [7552, 7560], [7619, 7658], [2276, 2324], [2351, 2369]]"

In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said a two-member team would meet the ship at Miami to investigate the fire.; The board has been concerned about the potential for accidents in the cruise ship industry and has held hearings around the nation.
Last year, it placed cruise ships on its ""most wanted"" list of safety improvements.; Steck said the fire, which started in a pantry between the fifth and seventh decks, apparently was caused by an electrical problem, but no details were available.;
The fire broke out about 1 a.m. and spread to the 1,000-seat Follies Lounge, which was closed at the time.
It took about 4 1/2 hours to extinguish the blaze, the Coast Guard said.;
The 2,318 passengers and most of the 818 crew members were evacuated to a nearby port terminal before they were allowed to return to the ship at daybreak, Steck said.;
The 74,000-ton Sovereign of the Seas is one of the world's heaviest cruise ships and the largest in terms of its passenger capacity of 2,521, Steck said.","More than 3,000 passengers and crewmembers were evacuated early Wednesday from the Sovereign of the Seas cruise ship after a fire broke out in a pantry.

"Police wanted prosecutors to charge King with battery on an officer and resisting arrest, said King's lawyer, Robert Rentzer.
But the district attorney's office refused.; ""We have sent the case back to police for further investigation,"" said Deputy District Attorney Don Eastman.
""There are a lot of things we want to look at and a lot of witnesses who were not interviewed.""; The district attorney's office said officers failed to interview available witnesses, including two of King's passengers.
The 10 officers involved in the beating have been taken off patrol.
; King told reporters that there had been no high-speed car chase as they insisted, that he had done nothing to provoke the attack and that he was ""scared for my life"" during the beating.; ""I'm lucky they didn't kill me,"" he said.; Witnesses back King's version of what happened early Sunday morning in a Los Angeles suburb, and a CHP officer at the scene said he exhorted the police officers to stop the beating, but was told, in effect, to ""stay out of it,"" according to a source.;
The pursuit of King's white 1988 Hyundai was begun by CHP officers, who estimated that King's car was hitting speeds as high as 115 mph on a freeway.
The CHP officers said that they called for assistance and had pulled King over in the Terrace San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.; At that point, several Los Angeles police officers ""jumped into the mess,"" said a law enforcement source familiar with the report CHP officers filed with their supervisors.
When the car finally stopped off the freeway, King was ordered out of the car.; The source said that a police sergeant told the CHP that his officers would handle things.
Witnesses said that King was already lying on the ground when a police officer shot him with a stun gun, delivering an electrical shock.
Officers then clubbed him wildly.
There was a brief lull and King lay silent until one officer stomped on his head.; King said that police ""continued to pound on me and beat on me all over my body . . .
all over my body.
My ankles.
They beat where it hurt.
They beat my whole body where it hurt.""; King, lifting his hospital garb to show a large bruise on his chest, said police ""shocked me . . .
they paused for a minute and then they struck me across the face real hard with a billy club.""; Witnesses said three or four officers beat King in the two-minute tape, while as many as seven others stood by to watch.; ""Please stop!
Please stop!""
King pleaded as he was struck at least 40 times with police batons, said witness Dorothy Gibson.; King is black.
The races of the police officers involved have not been revealed.
King said he didn't hear any racial comments from the officers.; ""They beat me so bad I didn't pay attention to what they were saying,"" said King, who had been released from jail in December after serving 2 1/2 years on a second-degree robbery conviction.; ""When I saw it on TV, I thought, 'Is this something happening in South Africa or Kuwait?' "" said Keith Huling, 35, who lives in the same apartment complex as Holliday.
""Then I looked a little closer, and said, 'Hey, that's the park across the street.'
""; Witnesses said King did not resist arrest.; The stunning videotape was recorded by George Holliday, a plumber who was awakened about 12:30 a.m. Sunday by the sound of police helicopters overhead.
Holliday went to the terrace of his second-story apartment and, seeing police in the street below, decided to get some practice with his new videotape recorder.;
The world reacted with sickened shock and outrage to the brutal, but some some in the black community here reacted with more of a shrug.; ""You talk to people in the black community here, and they say, 'This is not news,' "" said Joe Hicks, an American Civil Liberties Union spokesman who grew up in the community.
""They say, 'Why are all the white people so surprised?
A guy got his butt beat by the cops.
It happens all the time.'
""; Behind the shrug, though, emotions run deep.
""There's nothing you can imagine the guy had done that would justify that kind of response,"" Hicks said.; Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, long controversial for racial statements he has made, called the brutality depicted on the tape ""an aberration.""; The department issued no statements Wednesday.
Agencies including the FBI, the LAPD, Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and the California Highway Patrol are investigating the beating.
;
Huling said he knows of other police beatings that he believes are racially motivated.
A prevailing sense in his neighborhood this week, he said, is that ""if I come home from work and make a turn on a red light, I'm going to get my butt kicked.""; The perception that non-Anglos are the targets of police brutality has been chronic here.; ""Whether that's a perception or a reality is almost beside the point, because the perception is the reality,"" said Zev Yaroslavsky, a councilman who has requested public hearings on brutality throughout the city.
""I am troubled by the fact that when I learned the person beaten was black, I wasn't surprised. . . .
It is rare that there's an Anglo that gets the crap beat out of him with a billy club.""; Yaroslavsky pointed to recent incidents of harassment of black people.
Just last December, businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes was handcuffed during a routine traffic stop.
The police department's subsequent apology to him came on the heels of a federal jury award of $540,000 to former major league baseball player Joe Morgan, who said Los Angeles police in 1988 had grabbed him by the neck, thrown him to the ground and cuffed him at Los Angeles International Airport when they thought he was a drug courier.
; Last year, 55 residents of one of the city's streets accepted a $3 million settlement for damages from a 1988 police drug raid in which officers allegedly wrecked apartments and beat several people.; ""I don't think the body politic in Los Angeles has been willing to address it,"" Yaroslavsky said.
""But what the public has seen in black and white, no pun intended, leaves nothing to the imagination, leaves nothing to interpretation, (and) probably is the one event that may sensitize"" the politicians.","Black residents in Los Angeles say that the widely publicized King beating is not news.

"But out West, politicians are still expected to support NRA leadership.
The conventional wisdom still is: If you cross the gun lobby, they'll have a silver bullet waiting for you at the next election.
; I'm betting that those days are over.
I will vote for the Brady Bill -- the seven-day waiting period for persons wanting to buy handguns -- and for restrictions on the sale and domestic manufacture of assault weapons.; Don't misunderstand:
The NRA has a strong presence throughout my state.
Oregon probably has a lot more pickups with gun racks than Volvos with ski racks.
A landmark I'll never forget in Newberg, Ore., was a gun store named ""Toys for Big Boys.""
The NRA in Oregon is 62,000 members strong, and there are about 150 gun clubs in the state.; I USED to tell myself that gun control isn't crime control and -- comforted by that thought -- I let my 100 percent NRA rating keep arguments about guns from consuming the time I felt I needed for the issues I came to Congress to advance: jobs, education, family security and social justice.; What has been happening in our streets has changed my mind dramatically.
Handguns alone have killed about 50,000 people in the United States since the Brady Bill was last considered by Congress.
Oregonians in ""safe"" neighborhoods face gun violence unthinkable when I was first elected to Congress in 1974.
; Youth gangs with bulging arsenals cruise up and down Interstate 5 on the West Coast to ply their drug trade in our cities.
Just a few weeks ago, a gang knocked over a gun shop in rural Hood River to steal sophisticated firearms, including assault weapons, apparently intended for sale on the black market.
One youth was shot to death during the crime.
; The '80s shattered Oregonians' dearly held image of their state as an island in a sea of national crime and violence.
When a gunman with a long criminal history blew away five children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard two years ago, Oregonians were appalled to discover he'd bought his assault rifle in Sandy, Ore.
Even Oregon gun lobbyists privately conceded our state's problems with criminal and negligent use of firearms.; AS CRIME got worse, I discovered what an ideological straitjacket that NRA seal of approval can be.
If New Jersey's mandatory background check for handgun purchases has caught 10,000 convicted felons trying to buy handguns, how could I honestly tell myself that gun control isn't crime control?;
If, as the nation just learned last week, more teen-age boys now die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes combined, how could I continue to separate neatly the increasing carnage in communities from ""my issues"" of jobs, education, social justice and family security?
I couldn't.
; A couple of years ago, after listening to my own anti-gun-control spiel one time too many, I realized how threadbare it sounded.
I started paying closer attention to the arguments on both sides of the Brady Bill and assault weapon curbs.; I lent an ear to some unexpected gun control advocates: a janitor who accosted me angrily after a teachers' meeting in Beaverton; Newberg's police chief, who is also an NRA member; and my own wife, who grew up -- as I did -- in rural Redmond, where some are fond of saying you learn to shoot before you learn to read.
; I used to think I listened; now I've heard.
What I've heard convinces me that the conventional wisdom about the NRA's clout is hopelessly out of touch -- and that the leaders of the NRA are out of touch too.
Most of the people I represent are now more concerned about gun violence than they are about whatever inconvenience may be caused by a seven-day waiting period, which can prevent felons, drug addicts and the mentally disturbed from buying handguns.
; The Brady bill and assault weapon curbs aren't panaceas for crime, but evidence at the state level shows they will help.
; MY CONSTITUENTS want policies that reduce violent crime, regardless of whether they are labeled ""gun control.""
The gun lobby guarantees its political irrelevance by denying that.
By opposing moderate measures like the Brady Bill -- which public opinion research shows 87 percent of gun owners favor -- the leadership of the NRA has made its congressional supporters patsies in a game of lethal consequences.
; This time, the gun lobby has overplayed its hand.
Frankly, I'm sick of it, and I'm sick of gun violence.
; After too long at the table, I'm ready to do what I can to bust up the game.","An editorial in the San Jose Mercury News by Representative Les AuCoin explains why he no longer votes the NRA line.
Following is a brief summary of his thoughts: AuCoin notes that crime has increased since his election; with 50,000 gun deaths since the Brady Bill was first proposed.
The streets are dangerous, he feels, with increased crime and gang activity.
This has convinced him to abandon the NRA line and support the Brady Bill.
AuCoin says that Oregon is no longer an island.
AuCoin believes his constituents are less concerned by a waiting period than about the increasing gun violence.","[[241, 271], [759, 996], [2162, 2240], [3444, 3492], [4418, 4464], [1125, 1171], [1193, 1217], [1223, 1233], [1282, 1336], [1079, 1090], [1282, 1299], [1366, 1371], [1394, 1412], [1444, 1467], [1505, 1535], [241, 271], [3334, 3362], [3468, 3492], [4293, 4330], [1723, 1743], [1757, 1790], [3506, 3532], [3537, 3590], [3631, 3632], [3643, 3657]]"
"Hundreds of confidential documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times indicate that officers who stopped the Altadena motorist played down his injuries in their official reports.; But Highway Patrol officers at the scene told investigators that they were shocked by the ferocity of the beating.; Police have now determined that 21 Los Angeles police officers were at the scene, instead of 15 as initially reported.
There were also three Highway Patrol officers and two school police officers.
; Police officers, unaware that they had been videotaped by an amateur video buff, said in their reports that King suffered cuts and bruises ""of a minor nature.""; In contrast, the Highway Patrol officers were so taken aback that they jotted down Los Angeles officers' names.
; ""I didn't see any need to hit him with a baton,"" Officer Melanie Singer of the Highway Patrol later told investigators.; The conflicting accounts are contained in hundreds of pages of confidential police reports, witness interviews and other official law enforcement materials collected by investigators and studied by the county grand jury, which indicted a sergeant and three officers last week.
;
In ""use of force"" reports submitted by Sgt.
Stacey Koon and officers Laurence M. Powell and Timothy Wind, King's injuries were listed as ""contusions and abrasions.""; They also marked boxes on the use of force reports saying King ""attacked officers,"" ""continued some resistance"" and ""increased his resistance.""
The videotape shows that King was often in a defenseless position.; The grand jury indicted Koon, Powell, Wind and Officer Ted Briseno on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and beating a suspect under color of authority.
Koon and Powell were also charged with filing a false police report.; After the arrest, Koon wrote in his daily report that reinforcements are needed to ensure a suspect's submission because sometimes batons and electric stun guns don't work the way they are supposed to.; Highway Patrol Officers Tim and Melanie Singer said they saw the first half-dozen blows inflicted on King.
Another Highway Patrol officer, Gabriel Aid, said he arrived after King was hogtied.
Aid said one Los Angeles police officer asked him, ""Did you get any blood on your hands?""; The Singers, a husband-and-wife team, saw King when he and two passengers were driving on Interstate 210 at what Melanie Singer estimated were speeds of up to 100 mph.;
She said King refused to stop, even after her husband advised him over their car bullhorn: ""Pull over to the right.
We won't hurt you.""; Los Angeles police joined the pursuit.
Melanie Singer said that, when King got out of the car, he appeared jovial, dancing and ""heavily intoxicated.""
One passenger in King's car said they had been drinking malt liquor.; As Melanie Singer approached King, she said Koon told her, ""No, no.
Get back.
We'll handle.""
She said Koon shot King twice with a Taser stun gun, and King stumbled to the ground.; ""Officer Powell ran up and struck the suspect on the right side of his head with his baton,"" she told investigators.
""The suspect clasped his hands to his face and screamed with pain.
He was bleeding.
Powell then struck him five to six more times in rapid succession in the head and neck area.""; She described the blows as ""causing his face to split.""; At that point, she said, another Los Angeles police officer grabbed Powell's arm to stop him, and Koon yelled at Powell, ""Stop!
Stop!
That's enough!""; ""Mr. King appeared to be less resistive,"" she recalled.
""I considered him disabled.""; None of the Los Angeles officers gave King instructions, she said.","Police now say that 21 officers were present as Rodney King was shot with a stun gun and beaten about the head and body with clubs as he lay hog-tied on the ground.

; The length of this ""period of totality,"" as it's known, will depend on where viewers are along the path.
The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast.
In the Bay Area, the moon will cover about 55 percent of the sun's surface.;
Among fans of the heavens, a solar eclipse inspires awe, fascination and grandeur.
Firm estimates aren't available, but blotted-out-sun watchers are expected to number more than 100,000 -- perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 in Hawaii and an equal number in Baja.;
""The effect of it -- the view of seeing the sun disappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappear and having the birds stop singing -- it's miraculous,"" said Irving Hochman, a member of the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers.
""It really is the most spectacular natural phenomenon possible.""; Bob Bruynesteyn, head of the San Mateo Astronomical Society, puts it succinctly: ""Not too many people have stood in the shadow of the moon.""; It's romantic images like these that are inspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents say.; Pamela and Daniel Dei Rossi of Campbell were among those scramblers.
Learning of the eclipse only a month ago, they began calling travel agents.
""But they basically said they wouldn't even try -- everything was booked,"" said Pamela Dei Rossi.;
They called places where relatives had stayed in Mexico.
No luck.
She called a friend in Hawaii for a place to stay, but airline ticket and rental car problems still loomed.
Then, good fortune struck.
She called a travel agent who had taken a class with West Valley College astronomy instructor Tom Bullock.
Bullock was leading a group to Hawaii, and some late cancellations came up.
The Dei Rossis were in.; ""We are so excited,"" Pamela Dei Rossi said.
""We had given up.""; Though travel arrangements are now tough to come by, some opportunities remain.
; One is to go by the back door.; Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots, because -- statistically at least -- they offer the best chance of cloudless skies.
But after enveloping the Big Island and then slicing across southern Baja, the moon's shadow will cross the Gulf of California and race across the southern flank of Mexico and down the west coast of Central America.
Two of Mexico's biggest cities, Gaudalajara and Mexico City, lie in the path of totality.
So does Mazatlan.; Puerto Vallarta, a resort city, is only a short distance away.
Airline ticket availability is reported spotty for the resorts but still available for other destinations.; Another possibility is to search around for groups making the trip that have had late cancellations, as the Dei Rossis did.; What probably won't work is the overland route to Baja.
From the border to the northern edge of where the eclipse will be total is about a 16-hour drive, said Raul Cardenas, the Mexican consul in San Jose.
Mexican authorities will have a checkpoint from July 7-15 at Guerrero Negro, about halfway down the peninsula.
Travelers who can't produce original documents showing they have accommodations will be turned back, Cardenas said.
Those staying in private homes must also produce a letter of some kind, he said.
; Even firm reservations may not be all they seem.
Airlines routinely overbook seats, in expectation of no-shows.
With the eclipse, there's concern the overbooking could be particularly bad, especially on inter-island flights in Hawaii.
That's important because many eclipse-watchers haven't been able to book a flight directly to the Big Island.
They've had to get flights into somewhere else, like Honolulu, and do a short hop to where they want to be.; ""These flights are so overbooked it's actually a laughingstock,"" said O'Brien's Kloetzel.
""I have a feeling this is going to be an ugly scene.""; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; An eight-page brochure on the July 11 eclipse is available for $2 from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 390 Ashton Ave., San Francisco, CA 94112.
Special Mylar viewers for safely observing the eclipse are also available for another $2.","One of the longest total eclipses this century will pass from Hawaii through the southern Baja California peninsula into central Brazil.

"Her neighborhood was leveled.
The Tolentinos and 100 other poor families along the Albacan River in Angeles, a once-bustling city of 280,000 people in the shadow of Mount Pinatubo, lost their homes Saturday in mudslides and floods brought on by the volcano's powerful eruption.
; One resident, an elderly man, drowned in the torrent of thick volcanic ash and rainwater.; Because of impassable roads and downed telephone lines, it was still impossible Monday to determine the extent of the damage.
; The death toll from the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, combined with a series of earthquakes and torrential rains, increased to more than 200, according to Philippine television.
The Philippine Red Cross said at least 101 people had been killed.;
The government estimated damage to property and crops at about $200 million.; Most of the deaths occurred when houses and other buildings collapsed under the weight of as much as eight inches of ash and sand spewed from the rumbling crater.; Hundreds of people across the island of Luzon were reported missing, while hundreds of thousands of others have been left homeless.; As many as 150,000 people fleeing the volcano were said to be crowding into evacuation centers Monday night in Manila, the capital, about 50 miles south of the volcano.; Volcano scientists continued to express a careful optimism.
Raymondo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said in an interview that while the volcano remained a threat, the eruptions were ""simmering down"" and ""significant, critical eruptions are probably over.""; Manila's domestic and international airports were scheduled to reopen today, three days after they were closed because of concern that ash from the volcano would damage jet engines.; Despite the optimism from scientists, however, the exodus of families fleeing the volcano area continued late Monday as buses and trucks caked with gray ash jammed roads leading into Manila.
The government has set up more than 100 makeshift shelters in churches, schools, army camps and gymnasiums in the capital.;
In the wake of the eruptions, Filipinos are facing monumental tasks.
Food and clean drinking water were running low in the central and southwestern portions of the main Luzon island, which bore the brunt of the volcano's week of fury.; Angeles was without electricity Monday and so many stores and gasoline stations were closed that it was difficult to find food and fuel.; Dozens of angry residents stormed a row of food shops in the city's market, forced open the doors with crowbars and carted away canned goods and other items, police and witnesses said.; ""We will die of hunger if we don't do this,"" one of the looters said.
; Fifteen people were arrested after more than 100 pigs were stolen from a farm near Angeles.; Another U.S. Navy flotilla steamed toward Subic Bay today to help speed the American exodus, and Filipinos complained that their government failed to prepare them for the devastating fury of Mount Pinatubo.; ""We were really caught flat-footed.
They had not expected anything of this magnitude,"" said Gov. Bren Guiao of Pampanga province, where about 120,000 refugees were seeking help.; ""It's about time we left,"" said Lisa Hedland, wife of an Air Force sergeant, as she prepared to board the cruiser Long Beach with her 15-month-old daughter.
""It's been horrible this past week.""; For most Filipinos fleeing the volcano, the journey to safety was less orderly and far more difficult.; ""We have nothing except the clothes we are wearing,"" said Solidad Santiago, a 41-year-old laundry worker from Angeles, who fled to a Manila evacuation center Sunday with most but not all of her family.; ""Our house collapsed because of the volcano,"" said Santiago, a widow, whose face showed signs of the wrenching fear of the past week.
""My oldest son stayed behind to try to guard our possessions.""; ""He should be here by now,"" she said.
""I have gone on the public address system here and called his name, but there is never any response.
I am very concerned.
I pray he is safe.""; Santiago and her family were among nearly 5,000 refugees who crowded Monday into the shaded bleachers of a Manila sports stadium that is being used as an evacuation center.
; The evacuees were provided with food -- mostly sausages, rice and crackers donated by local businesses.; ""We have lost everything, but still I am happy, happy to be here,"" said Romayo Garcia, a 29-year-old mason, whose house near the now-evacuated Clark Air Base, about 10 miles east of Mount Pinatubo, had collapsed from the weight of volcanic ash.; ""The rocks were as big as this,"" he said, bringing together his thumbs and index fingers to make a circle five inches wide.
""It was impossible to walk.
People panicked.
We had to find a way to get out.""; Garcia said he and several members of his family trudged nearly 20 miles through ankle-deep ash until they found a truck driver willing to take them to Manila.","There were many personal stories of panic and wrenching sadness as thousands of residents of the Mount Pinatubo area fled their homes after the eruption.

"There, in the segregated black Georgia of four decades past, began the toughening of Clarence Thomas, nominee to the United States Supreme Court.; Abandoned by his father, driven by his hard-eyed grandfather and a band of nuns sent south to teach black children, young Clarence learned sharecropping and scholarship, hard labor and the Latin mass, and how to survive the walk home through black Savannah in his Catholic school uniform.
; From these roots, he might have become one of any number of bright, activist black men to rise out of Southern poverty and press a politically aggressive liberal agenda of civil rights and affirmative action -- as did men like Thurgood Marshall, the retiring justice whose Supreme Court seat Thomas might take.; Instead, Thomas, now 43, became something else -- a hybrid product of harsh Southern history and baby-boom ambition, a proponent of personal strength over dependence, of individualism over government activism.
; By the time he arrived in Washington with the Reagan administration, he had developed into a rare breed -- a black conservative so impressive to Republican presidents that he was set on the road to the highest court in the land.
But he was so disturbing to traditional liberals that they are eager to deprive him of Senate confirmation in September.; Historically, trying to predict Supreme Court nominees has been extremely risky.
Still, many liberals are convinced that Thomas' past clearly shows his future.
He would, they say, oppose abortion rights, school busing plans and affirmative action programs.
He would also weaken the wall separating government and religion and further restrict the rights of criminal suspects and defendants.
; Not surprisingly, Thomas' many friends and supporters draw different conclusions.
They see him as an independent spirit, a probable centrist on a court that has been steering rightward for several years.
; The Georgia beginning; But any attempt to understand the potential successor to the revered Thurgood Marshall must begin in Georgia.; There, just the other day, Leola Williams, Thomas' mother, talked about how the force of family worked on her son:; ""Clarence was surrounded by all our older parents.
He saw how our family and other people struggled to make a living.;"" ""I guess Clarence wanted to prove to himself he could be what he wanted to be -- and prove to his grandfather he could be the kind of person (his grandfather) wanted him to be.""; The grandfather, the late Myers Anderson, began training Thomas in earnest when the boy was 9 and Leola Williams' life suddenly began coming apart.
Her house off Pin Point Avenue had gone up in smoke, and some months later, her husband went north to Philadelphia, leaving her with two young children and a third on the way.; Williams took her daughter, Emma Mae, and moved in with an aunt while she awaited the birth of her second son, Myers.
Clarence went to live with his grandparents in Savannah, to help with Anderson's year-round oil and ice delivery business.
; His grandfather proved to be a profound force in Thomas' life -- a mentor, a role model, an unrelenting taskmaster and the embodiment of a personal philosophy that Thomas once recalled this way:; ""He used to tell me that there was no problem that elbow grease couldn't solve.
Then he'd say, 'Old Man Can't is dead.
I helped bury him.'
""; When Anderson wasn't coaching Thomas, in his farm fields or on his delivery truck, he made sure the lessons continued, in the hands of the Franciscan nuns of all-black St. Benedict the Moor School.; Thomas, who had experienced racial mistreatment by white seminarians in Georgia, ultimately rejected seminary life.
He has identified an episode at Immaculate Conception Seminary in Conception, Mo., in 1968 as the final humiliation.
He said he heard a seminarian there react to the shooting of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by saying, ""Good, I hope the son of a bitch dies.""; Thomas left the seminary and went north to enroll at Holy Cross College in the gritty New England factory city of Worcester, Mass.; A Southerner in New England; The Southern farm boy was forced to endure not only the harsh winters of New England, but also the chilly atmosphere of a white college just beginning to widen opportunities for blacks.;
Within days of King's assassination, the school created a scholarship fund named after the civil-rights leader and stepped up the recruiting of blacks.
And so Thomas, who was driven from the Missouri seminary by racism, became one of the beneficiaries of an effort to combat it.; Thomas, who paid for his college education with loans, jobs and the newly raised scholarship funds, soon was drawn into the turbulence of Vietnam War and ""black power"" politics.;
He helped found a Black Student Union, writing and typing its constitution.
In December 1969, he and other black students resigned to protest the suspensions of black students who had blocked a General Electric recruiter on campus.
Stung, school officials granted a blanket amnesty and the students returned.; Thomas went on to run track and write for the campus newspaper.
He graduated from Holy Cross with honors and left for Yale University Law School in New Haven, Conn.; Freewheeling liberalism; ""He came into law school espousing liberal views from his freewheeling, unattached undergraduate days,"" said Harry Singleton, a black classmate, close friend and a former civil rights official in the Reagan Education Department.; ""But he became more conservative as he went through the process of legal education.""; Yale law students, Singleton explained, were exposed to conservative law professors with powerful minds.; ""I used to discuss conservative ideas with Clarence and he was interested in them,"" Singleton said.
""They were about the dangers of big government trying to solve all the ills of society and how every time you do that you take away from the liberties of the people.""; But it was Thomas Sowell, the conservative black economist now at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, whose work came to grip Thomas' mind.; Shortly after his arrival at Yale, Thomas remembered when someone gave him one of Sowell's books and ""I threw it in the trash"" because ""it really went against all the things we'd been indoctrinated to believe about the radical movement and the peace movement."";
But after law school, Thomas rediscovered one of Sowell's books.
Sowell's provocative 1983 work, ""The Economics and Politics of Race,"" was ""manna from heaven,"" Thomas said.
;
In that book, Sowell, arguing from a laissez-faire perspective, endorsed the notion that blacks would benefit more from pursuing economic achievement than political agitation.; From Yale to Washington; Thomas, always a top student, was recruited out of Yale in 1974 by John Danforth, R-Mo., then Missouri attorney general, a Yale trustee and a frequent campus visitor.
Danforth brought Thomas to Jefferson City, Mo., to work in the attorney general's office.;
When Danforth became a U.S. senator in 1977, Thomas stayed in St. Louis to work as an assistant counsel for the Monsanto Corp., then in 1979 joined Danforth in Washington as a legislative aide.
;
Reagan administration officials were so impressed by Thomas and his new conservative leanings that they appointed him assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education.
In 1982, they promoted him to the more visible post of chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
There controversy dogged him for the next eight years.; Congress learned in 1989 that the EEOC under Thomas' direction had permitted more than 13,000 age discrimination claims to lapse.; Civil-rights groups accused Thomas of failing to enforce other anti-discrimination laws as well, and of retaliating against employees who disagreed with his policies.; Thomas concentrated on winning relief for victims of actual discrimination.
He steered away from lawsuits based on statistical evidence and remedies that included timetables for future hiring.; But he was unwilling to go along with more strident voices in the Reagan administration who opposed most legal remedies for discrimination, so he often felt isolated from both the administration and the civil rights establishment.
;
Several years ago, a top Reagan domestic adviser who wanted his coffee cup refilled at a black-tie dinner looked up and spotted a black man in a tuxedo hovering near the table.
Holding the cup aloft, the official asked for more coffee.
The black man reached past the cup to shake hands and said evenly: ""Perhaps we haven't met.

His father deserted the family, and Clarence was raised by his maternal grandparents.
Under the direction of his grandfather and the nuns who schooled him, he learned sharecropping, scholarship, and hard labor.
He was later impressed by Thomas Sowell, a prominent black economist, who advised blacks to pursue economic independence rather than political agitation.
He developed into a hybrid product of harsh Southern history and baby-boomer ambition, and a proponent of strength over dependence.
His black conservatism made him a favorite of Republican administrations.","[[8762, 8777], [8957, 8964], [8966, 8986], [147, 170], [2904, 2947], [172, 185], [196, 226], [269, 327], [407, 426], [5941, 5961], [5980, 5995], [6056, 6081], [6535, 6541], [6585, 6695], [759, 765], [775, 781], [800, 915], [1031, 1033], [1069, 1089], [1093, 1128]]"
"There, in the segregated black Georgia of four decades past, began the toughening of Clarence Thomas, nominee to the United States Supreme Court.; Abandoned by his father, driven by his hard-eyed grandfather and a band of nuns sent south to teach black children, young Clarence learned sharecropping and scholarship, hard labor and the Latin mass, and how to survive the walk home through black Savannah in his Catholic school uniform.
; From these roots, he might have become one of any number of bright, activist black men to rise out of Southern poverty and press a politically aggressive liberal agenda of civil rights and affirmative action -- as did men like Thurgood Marshall, the retiring justice whose Supreme Court seat Thomas might take.; Instead, Thomas, now 43, became something else -- a hybrid product of harsh Southern history and baby-boom ambition, a proponent of personal strength over dependence, of individualism over government activism.
; By the time he arrived in Washington with the Reagan administration, he had developed into a rare breed -- a black conservative so impressive to Republican presidents that he was set on the road to the highest court in the land.
But he was so disturbing to traditional liberals that they are eager to deprive him of Senate confirmation in September.; Historically, trying to predict Supreme Court nominees has been extremely risky.
Still, many liberals are convinced that Thomas' past clearly shows his future.
He would, they say, oppose abortion rights, school busing plans and affirmative action programs.
He would also weaken the wall separating government and religion and further restrict the rights of criminal suspects and defendants.
; Not surprisingly, Thomas' many friends and supporters draw different conclusions.
They see him as an independent spirit, a probable centrist on a court that has been steering rightward for several years.
; The Georgia beginning; But any attempt to understand the potential successor to the revered Thurgood Marshall must begin in Georgia.; There, just the other day, Leola Williams, Thomas' mother, talked about how the force of family worked on her son:; ""Clarence was surrounded by all our older parents.
He saw how our family and other people struggled to make a living.;"" ""I guess Clarence wanted to prove to himself he could be what he wanted to be -- and prove to his grandfather he could be the kind of person (his grandfather) wanted him to be.""; The grandfather, the late Myers Anderson, began training Thomas in earnest when the boy was 9 and Leola Williams' life suddenly began coming apart.
Her house off Pin Point Avenue had gone up in smoke, and some months later, her husband went north to Philadelphia, leaving her with two young children and a third on the way.; Williams took her daughter, Emma Mae, and moved in with an aunt while she awaited the birth of her second son, Myers.
Clarence went to live with his grandparents in Savannah, to help with Anderson's year-round oil and ice delivery business.
; His grandfather proved to be a profound force in Thomas' life -- a mentor, a role model, an unrelenting taskmaster and the embodiment of a personal philosophy that Thomas once recalled this way:; ""He used to tell me that there was no problem that elbow grease couldn't solve.
Then he'd say, 'Old Man Can't is dead.
I helped bury him.'
""; When Anderson wasn't coaching Thomas, in his farm fields or on his delivery truck, he made sure the lessons continued, in the hands of the Franciscan nuns of all-black St. Benedict the Moor School.; Thomas, who had experienced racial mistreatment by white seminarians in Georgia, ultimately rejected seminary life.
He has identified an episode at Immaculate Conception Seminary in Conception, Mo., in 1968 as the final humiliation.
He said he heard a seminarian there react to the shooting of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by saying, ""Good, I hope the son of a bitch dies.""; Thomas left the seminary and went north to enroll at Holy Cross College in the gritty New England factory city of Worcester, Mass.; A Southerner in New England; The Southern farm boy was forced to endure not only the harsh winters of New England, but also the chilly atmosphere of a white college just beginning to widen opportunities for blacks.;
Within days of King's assassination, the school created a scholarship fund named after the civil-rights leader and stepped up the recruiting of blacks.
And so Thomas, who was driven from the Missouri seminary by racism, became one of the beneficiaries of an effort to combat it.; Thomas, who paid for his college education with loans, jobs and the newly raised scholarship funds, soon was drawn into the turbulence of Vietnam War and ""black power"" politics.;
He helped found a Black Student Union, writing and typing its constitution.
In December 1969, he and other black students resigned to protest the suspensions of black students who had blocked a General Electric recruiter on campus.
Stung, school officials granted a blanket amnesty and the students returned.; Thomas went on to run track and write for the campus newspaper.
He graduated from Holy Cross with honors and left for Yale University Law School in New Haven, Conn.; Freewheeling liberalism; ""He came into law school espousing liberal views from his freewheeling, unattached undergraduate days,"" said Harry Singleton, a black classmate, close friend and a former civil rights official in the Reagan Education Department.; ""But he became more conservative as he went through the process of legal education.""; Yale law students, Singleton explained, were exposed to conservative law professors with powerful minds.; ""I used to discuss conservative ideas with Clarence and he was interested in them,"" Singleton said.
""They were about the dangers of big government trying to solve all the ills of society and how every time you do that you take away from the liberties of the people.""; But it was Thomas Sowell, the conservative black economist now at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, whose work came to grip Thomas' mind.; Shortly after his arrival at Yale, Thomas remembered when someone gave him one of Sowell's books and ""I threw it in the trash"" because ""it really went against all the things we'd been indoctrinated to believe about the radical movement and the peace movement."";
But after law school, Thomas rediscovered one of Sowell's books.
Sowell's provocative 1983 work, ""The Economics and Politics of Race,"" was ""manna from heaven,"" Thomas said.
;
In that book, Sowell, arguing from a laissez-faire perspective, endorsed the notion that blacks would benefit more from pursuing economic achievement than political agitation.; From Yale to Washington; Thomas, always a top student, was recruited out of Yale in 1974 by John Danforth, R-Mo., then Missouri attorney general, a Yale trustee and a frequent campus visitor.
Danforth brought Thomas to Jefferson City, Mo., to work in the attorney general's office.;
When Danforth became a U.S. senator in 1977, Thomas stayed in St. Louis to work as an assistant counsel for the Monsanto Corp., then in 1979 joined Danforth in Washington as a legislative aide.
;
Reagan administration officials were so impressed by Thomas and his new conservative leanings that they appointed him assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education.
In 1982, they promoted him to the more visible post of chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
There controversy dogged him for the next eight years.; Congress learned in 1989 that the EEOC under Thomas' direction had permitted more than 13,000 age discrimination claims to lapse.; Civil-rights groups accused Thomas of failing to enforce other anti-discrimination laws as well, and of retaliating against employees who disagreed with his policies.; Thomas concentrated on winning relief for victims of actual discrimination.
He steered away from lawsuits based on statistical evidence and remedies that included timetables for future hiring.; But he was unwilling to go along with more strident voices in the Reagan administration who opposed most legal remedies for discrimination, so he often felt isolated from both the administration and the civil rights establishment.

Several years ago, a top Reagan domestic adviser who wanted his coffee cup refilled at a black-tie dinner looked up and spotted a black man in a tuxedo hovering near the table.

"According to one writer, ""He said no to cabinet secretaries and to congressmen, to journalists and to job-hunters; he said no short and sharp without troubling to be polite about it; and so he would come to be warmly detested on the Hill, in the National Press Club, at Republican National Headquarters and across the country.""
And his improprieties, when they were revealed, shocked the nation and rocked the administration to its very foundations.
And he wasn't even named John Sununu.
; But the rise and fall of Sherman Adams, President Eisenhower's powerful chief-of-staff, is more than an interesting political doppleganger to the travails of his lineal heir, John Sununu.
The case of Sherman Adams sheds an eerie light on Sununu's rise in the ancient, stony soil of New Hampshire politics.
It gives us a grip on the origins of the presidential chief of staff, an unofficial position that has come to be a virtual American prime ministership.
And the course of Sherman Adams' humiliation may even allow us a perspective on the course of John Sununu's struggle for survival and possibly even a way to predict the timing of his ultimate demise.
; That Sherman Adams, the first ""assistant president"" and John Sununu, conceivably the last of the imperial chiefs of staff, were both catapulted from governor of the Granite state into national prominence is not at all coincidental.
Rather it stems from the strange configuration of American politics and New Hampshire's place in it.
With its ""first-in-the-nation"" primary, New Hampshire has historically exerted a pull far in excess of a population still only marginally larger than the city of Detroit.; Sherman Adams had risen in New Hampshire politics of the '30s and '40s because of his organizational abilities and the perception of his incorruptibility.
; After graduating from Dartmouth, Adams worked as a logging camp supervisor and eventually rose to become an executive in one of New Hampshire's leading timber companies.
In 1940, at the behest of his employers, he ran for a seat in the New Hampshire House, eventually becoming governor in 1949.
; When he took office, Adams began a program of streamlining and reducing state government that provided a model followed three decades later for another new New Hampshire governor, John Sununu.; In late 1951, New Hampshire was the launching pad for the campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower.; Eisenhower, with Adams' support, defeated the isolationist Sen. Robert Taft in the New Hampshire primary.
But Eisenhower and Taft ran neck and neck in subsequent state tests and arrived at the Republican Convention in Chicago virtually tied.
It was then that Eisenhower's top lieutenants came to Adams and asked him to become their candidate's floor manager.;
The 1952 Republican convention was the last national convention to go beyond one ballot.
And when Eisenhower did win, he asked Sherman Adams to become his personal campaign manager.; Bush's campaign debt; In a very similar way, three and a half decades later, George Bush paid off a very major campaign debt by appointing Sununu chief of staff.
Without Sununu, the chances are very good that the current president of the United States would not be named George Bush.;
In February 1988, a reeling Bush campaign limped into New Hampshire after finishing a near-fatal third in the Iowa caucus.
But the savvy Sununu, evidencing some of the high arrogance for which he has become justly famous, was not at all downcast.
""Isn't it great,"" he reportedly told a puzzled friend about the news in Iowa.
""Don't you see how much good I'm going to do for the next president of the United States?""; And true to his words, Sununu crafted an attack campaign that painted Bush's chief rival, Bob Dole, as a closet ""tax and spend"" liberal.
That ploy, plus a computerized get-out-the-vote campaign, crafted by Sununu on his own spreadsheet program, did the trick, and the rest is history.
; Unlike Sherman Adams, John Sununu could not be mistaken for a rock-ribbed Granite Stater.
Born in Havana, Cuba, the son of an immigrant Lebanese trader and a Greek mother from El Salvador, the stubby, rumpled Sununu liked to refer to himself as a ""universal ethnic.""; Three degrees from MIT; But an upper middle-class New York upbringing, a brilliant career at military school and three degrees from MIT put the reputed 180 I.Q. Sununu on the fast track.
In the early '60s, he began building a solid career running the several engineering firms he founded and also became a professor of physics at Tufts University.; Sununu was elected to the New Hampshire Assembly in 1972, and 10 years later became governor of New Hampshire on a conservative campaign theme of nuclear power, increased business and no new taxes.
; It was a propitious era to be governor of New Hampshire.
The state was coming out of the '82 recession and beginning a six-year boom that pumped enough revenue into the coffers to build a new state hospital and prison and still have money left over to give state employees raises.
According to Concord Monitor editor Mike Pride, ""Sununu did well; he fell into an easy time to be governor.""; Sununu was re-elected twice and gained a reputation as an activist governor.; He also developed a propensity for the excesses that would prove so costly in Washington.
Eschewing the mansion in Concord, Sununu chose to live an hour away from the capitol and be chauffeured to and from every day.
The Wall Street Journal noted that Sununu ""became an extremely powerful figure in a state where the powers of governor are not great.""; More or less the same thing could have been said about Sherman Adams when he gave up the New Hampshire governorship to become Dwight Eisenhower's ""assistant president"" in 1953.
; The reason for Adams' enormous power lay in the nature of the Eisenhower presidency.
Continuing the staff system that had proven itself during the war, Adams noted that ""Eisenhower simply expected me to manage a staff that would boil down, simplify and expedite the urgent business that had to be brought to his attention.""
It also meant that Adams would decide who and what crossed the president's threshold.
This power as the presidential gatekeeper has characterized the chief-of-staff position ever since.; Adams managed to keep the Eisenhower administration on a more or less even keel through the worst of the McCarthy outrages, through Eisenhower's heart attack in 1955, the Suez crises in 1956, the Little Rock school integration crimes in 1957 and the invasion of Lebanon in 1958.; According to Eisenhower, Adams was successful because ""From our first meeting in 1952, Sherman Adams seemed to me best described as laconic, abrupt, businesslike and puritanically honest.""
Adams was the shining example that Republicans could hold up that they had done something about their 1952 campaign slogan to ""clean up the mess in Washington.""; Thus, the spring 1958 revelations that Adams had for years enjoyed free hotel accommodations and accepted the now legendary vicuna coat and an expensive rug from an unsavory New England industrialist named Bernard Goldfine, while at the same time interceding with regulatory agencies on Goldfine's behalf, came as a major shock.;
Adams waged a vigorous and seemingly successful defense before a congressional committee, asserting that his worse crime had been ""a mistake of judgment, not of intent.""; And there things stood throughout the summer of 1958, with a somewhat tarnished Adams carrying out the role he had defined over the previous six years.
When pressed about Adams, the president insisted that he was his ""right-hand man . . .
the only man who really understands what I am trying to do.""
And when really pressed about why he kept Adams on, Eisenhower wailed at a press conference, ""I need him.""; In 1958, an Eisenhower administration without Sherman Adams was unthinkable.
Certainly more unthinkable than a Bush administration without John Sununu.
But as the summer of '58 progressed, it became clear that Adams was becoming an issue that could help the Democrats.
So when, in September 1958, Republicans were badly beaten in elections in Maine, and campaign contributions began to dry up, the pressure on Eisenhower to do something grew enormous.
But Eisenhower refused to personally fire his aide.
Instead, he delegated Vice President Nixon and the chair of the Republican Party to visit Adams.;
Ever the good soldier, Adams finally listened, and in late September quit.
The gesture was largely futile.
The year 1958 was the beginning of the Democratic renaissance that led to the election of John Kennedy in 1960.; Today, as Vice President Dan Quayle could tell you, John Sununu is no Sherman Adams.
Sununu is as brash as Adams was self-effacing and far more self-serving than Adams at his vicuna-coat worst.
Nevertheless, the continuing flap over Sununu's excesses and arrogance seem to mirror a transgenerational anger at a public official who flaunted the Washington establishment, who has made too many enemies trying too hard, and enjoying too much, being the bad cop to the president's good.;
And even if a controversial Supreme Court nomination has temporarily taken the spotlight off of Sununu, the current chief of staff ought to ponder well next year's coming election.
He might question if his strange, parochial antics may just provide the kind of ammunition in 1992 that the similarly alien behavior of Sherman Adams did 34 years before.
Ammunition that his own party will use to get rid of him in time for an upcoming election if not before.
(box)","Embattled Chief of Staff John Sununu might consider the case of another former Governor of New Hampshire who held the same White House job.
Sherman Adams was described as ""laconic, abrupt, businesslike and puritanically honest.""
But in the spring of 1958 it came to light that Adams had accepted gifts from an unsavory New England industrialist and had interceded with regulatory agencies on the industrialist's behalf.
When it became clear that Adams was becoming an issue that could help the Democrats in the elections that fall, Eisenhower sent Vice President Nixon and the Republican National Chairman to visit Adams.

"Welcome to Biosphere 2 -- a domed Garden of Eden in the foothills of the Santa Catalina mountains outside Tucson.
Here, beginning on Thursday, four men and four women will confine themselves for two years in one of the most bizarre research escapades in modern times.; Is it science or schlock?
A tour de force or a tourist trap?
; A year behind schedule and five years in the making, Biosphere 2 has forged ahead despite questions about its credibility, charges of cultism and accusations that leaders bullied departed consultants.
; The creation of billionaire oil mogul Edward Bass, Biosphere 2 aims to study how people can live in an airtight world.
In this biological maze, plants will recycle human wastes and turn them into the sustenance of life -- air, food and water.;
Biosphere 2 could be the first step in the construction of a massive way station in space, its developers hope, and at the very least could help improve life on Earth.;
But as the ""Biospherians"" prepare to don their spiffy blue jump suits and kiss the outside world goodbye, Earthlings are watching with a mixture of awe, fascination and skepticism.; Supporters gush that the grand experiment rivals the moon landing.
Detractors snicker that Biosphere 2 could be the greatest stunt since ""War of the Worlds.""; ""I don't know what they are attempting to do,"" said Robert D. MacElroy, a scientist at NASA/Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, where plans for a small space cottage are in their infancy.;
MacElroy has visited the Biosphere 2 project and said, ""There's a pretty grotesque size differential to what we're involved in.
I don't know . . .
how it would help with what we're doing.""; 'NASA could never do this'; ""NASA could never do this,"" countered Robert Frye, a project consultant and ecologist at the University of Arizona's Environmental Research Laboratory.
""NASA would have spent a hundred million dollars and come up with a roomful of reports.
But Biosphere 2 has a structure that can be used and studied for 100 years."";
Looking like Hollywood's ""Battlestar Gallactica,"" the gleaming steel-and-glass shell of Biosphere 2 is as long as three football fields and as tall as a five-story building.
Inside are parts of a South American rain forest, a Caribbean coral reef and ocean, a Florida freshwater swamp, a Baja desert and a tropical Australian savannah.
They are inhabited by 3,800 transplanted species of birds, reptiles, plants and insects.
; The eight Biospherians, all single, will electronically monitor their world through a maze of computers in the glitzy command center.
A short walk will take them from the shore of an ocean to the mountains of a rain forest to barren desert.
They will live in modern loft apartments and be under the constant watch of Biosphere 1 -- the Earth -- from a ""Mission Control"" located across the street.
; The mood inside Biosphere 2 was upbeat last week as participants counted down the days until Thursday's ""closure,"" when air locks will be shut and the crew sealed inside.
They seemed unperturbed by continuing questions from reporters about the project's credibility.;
News reports since 1985 have linked the project's leaders to a 1970s commune where, some ex-commune members say, Biosphere 2 executive John Allen led a cult devoted to creating a new civilization.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that one of Allen's protege's was oilman Bass, Biosphere 2's main financier.; Leader was a 'tyrant'; Laurence Veysey, a retired history professor from the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studied the commune in 1971, remembers Allen as a tyrant given to rages.
Veysey recalls seeing ""biosphere"" written on a dining-room wall of the New Mexico commune, Synergia Ranch.; ""They were a very secretive group,"" said Veysey, who devoted 100 pages to the ranch in a book on communes.
""It was hard to figure out what they were up to.""; In the years since the commune disbanded, Allen's vision and Bass's deep pockets have funded ecological ventures from Katmandu to France to western Australia.
One was the Institute of Ecotechnics in London, billed by Biosphere 2 as ""a major-ecological think-tank.""
Several of Biosphere 2's leaders have unaccredited degrees from the institute.; Institute non-existent; A Canadian television documentary last year went looking for the institute and found only an office over a cafe and art gallery.; Allen and Bass could not be reached for comment.
In the past, Bass has denied being influenced by Allen, who told the Arizona Daily Star in June that he never operated ""any mystical program.""; ""The whole cult thing is ridiculous,"" said Kathleen Dyhr, spokeswoman for Biosphere 2.
""There have been so many people with Biosphere 2 who never had anything to do with John Allen 20 years ago.""; During construction, Biosphere 2 recruited outside consultants from such reputable institutions as Yale University and the Smithsonian, Dyhr said.
And many of the ecological studies here have been lauded by the scientific community, she said.; Project has defectors; But at least a half-dozen respected researchers have left the project, citing differences of substance and style.
Some later recanted their criticisms, saying they were warned by Biosphere representatives they could be sued for libel.; Even now, many mainstream scientists wonder what Biosphere 2 will accomplish.; Its makers contend they have made an ecological system ""out of nothing.""
But the structure will be powered by a set of natural gas generators and maintained by a staff of 50 outside support people.
; Some scientists also wonder whether Biosphere 2 will be leakproof.
How will it hold up under the elements?
And if they survive two years, what will Biospherians learn, other than how to live in a gigantic terrarium?; Naivety suggested; ""I think they went into this rather naively,"" said Frank Salisbury, a plant physiologist at Utah State University.
""I hope something good comes out of this, but I'm skeptical.""; Biosphere 2 officials counter that something good already has, and point to 50 design patents in the works.
; First and foremost, they say, Biosphere 2 is a business.
It's already the state's second largest tourist attraction after the Grand Canyon, and promoters are banking that more than a million people a year will visit.
; In fact, in the first five months of 1991, 65,000 people came to see the project, a hundredfold increase over the same period in 1990.; Shown a movie and taken on a walking tour for $9.95, visitors mostly gush over the landscape and rarely ask probing questions.
They crowd the gift shop buying up Biosphere 2 memorabilia.; ""It's really turning out to be nothing more than a tourist attraction,"" said Yvonne Clearwater, an environmental psychologist at NASA/Ames who sees little scientific value to Biosphere 2.; ""It's kind of like a kooky Disneyland.""","Biosphere II, a domed glass and steel Garden of Eden in the foothills of Arizona's Santa Catalina range, will begin an experiment on Thursday in a biological maze where plants will recycle human wastes and turn them into the sustenance of life--air, food, and water.

"""Improved cruise ship safety is on the most-wanted list at the board,"" he said.; Sadly, it is true that major steps in ship safety have followed great disasters: The General Slocum fire, which killed 950 people in 1904, brought tighter requirements for life-saving gear and fire-fighting equipment; the Titanic, with its loss of 1,500 lives in 1912, brought rules on life-saving devices and certifying of lifeboat personnel; in the '30s, the Morro Castle fire, which cost 124 lives, and the Mohawk sinking, with a loss of 45 lives, brought regulations on the structure, equipment and materials of passenger ships.
; The Andrea Doria crash in 1956, in which 47 died, inspired requirements that ship hulls be divided by steel bulkheads.; When the Yarmouth Castle burned and sank in 1965, taking 90 lives, Congress banned wood construction on passenger ships.
And the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations body with headquarters in London, enacted similar regulations when it overhauled the Safety of Life at Sea code in 1974.
; Despite these reforms and improvements, Pollock believes the cruise ship industry has been lucky there haven't been more fatalities during the last decade.; ""We don't look at fatalities as a measure of safety,"" he said.; ""We look at the types of accidents that occur.
Things may go OK under ideal circumstances, but accidents don't happen under ideal circumstances.""; Pollock fears that Congress, the Coast Guard and the International Maritime Organization are not moving fast enough to mandate safeguards, despite 176 deaths last year in an arsonist's fire on the Scandinavian Star ferry in Denmark, and the dramatic images of the cruise ship Oceanos, which sank off South Africa early in August, fortunately without loss of life.; Safety experts are primarily concerned with three issues: fire protection, particularly in the big atria of new cruise ships, the ability of crew members to give safety instructions in a language that passengers understand, and the aging of the world fleet of cruise ships.; American passengers frequently assume that any ship they board in a U.S. port has met all Coast Guard safety requirements, a notion reinforced by ""Coast Guard approved"" labels on most life jackets, and fire systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries.;
In fact, the Coast Guard gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the United States, but when the vessel is registered in another country, the Coast Guard only makes sure the ship provides whatever is required by international Safety of Life at Sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition.; Once a year, the Coast Guard observes an evacuation drill.
If equipment is not in order, the Coast Guard can prevent the boarding of passengers until things are up to snuff.
; The application of the rules is not universal: the older the vessel, the less stringent the requirements, because Safety of Life at Sea rules have grandfather clauses.;
Age: no automatic alarm; A vessel need comply only with the rules in effect at the time the keel was laid or it last underwent major reconstruction.
When the rules were initially adopted by the International Maritime Organization, it was assumed that older vessels would pass out of service, but this did not happen, according to Marjorie Murtagh of the Coast Guard, the U.S. fire-safety representative at the International Maritime Organization.;
Of the 100 large vessels now operating from U.S. ports -- all but two are of foreign registry -- 72 are more than 10 years old, 23 are more than 20 years old and 26 are more than 30 years old, according to figures in the Coast Guard magazine Proceedings of the Marine Safety Council.
Thus, 70 percent of vessels visiting the United States need not meet the most recent international rules, enacted in 1974 to cover ships built after May 1980.; However, everyone who deals with these figures points out that age is not an automatic indicator of an unsafe vessel.
For instance, the Britanis was built in 1932 of a steel design not required until after the Andrea Doria.; Rear Adm. Joel D. Sipes, former chief of the Coast Guard's Office of Marine Safety, testified in Congress this spring: ""We have been concerned for a number of years that the grandfather clauses create an incentive to bring more and more older ships back into service.
We already see an aging of the fleet, and a resurgence in refurbishment without safety upgrading.""; Death rate falls; However, the casualty rate on cruise ships has been low in recent years.
The National Transportation Safety Board in 1989 published a study of 36 accidents in 15 years on vessels that touched U.S. ports.
Of the 176 deaths listed, only five were aboard ocean-going cruise vessels under foreign flags.
; William A. O'Neil, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization, fears that may change, partly because of the leeway the grandfather rules give for refitting.
""The average age of ships today is 16 years, which is already fairly elderly in shipping terms and old ships need more maintenance and repair,"" he said in a statement last month.;
In May, the safety committee of the International Maritime Organization met in London to begin amending the Safety of Life at Sea rules.
; The proposed amendments, which are supported by the majority of the member countries, require that new ships' atriums have smoke-detection systems, smoke-exhaust systems, two means of escape and an automatic sprinkler system.; The committee also discussed a phase-out of the grandfather rules.
One peculiar gap in existing regulations involves vessels built under the 1974 rules, which banned wood construction, but for the first time did not require sprinkler systems.; These vessels would probably be among the first existing vessels required to install sprinklers.; Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United States have entered proposals to cover older vessels immediately, or to modify sharply the permissive rules.
Roger Kohn, information officer for the maritime organization in London, said the loss of the Oceanos ""tended to confirm a general feeling that something must be done.""; John T. Estes, president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the owners of most of the ocean-going cruise vessels, said that his organization favored all the proposed new rules, but not the proposed effective dates.; When the safety committee met in May, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.; Estes said that accounting for the lead time required for ship design, his organization favors 1996 for enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction.
; The 15 major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without difficulty, according to Comdr.
Anthony Dupree, chief of the inspection department of the Coast Guard in New York.
In U.S. ports, he said, any work is generally done quickly ""because passengers are the lines' meat and potatoes, and we can keep them from boarding.""; These inspections, done every three months, should assure passengers, according to Lieut.
Comdr.
John J. O'Brien Jr., the Coast Guard's deputy chief.; ""If you fly to another country to save a few dollars,"" he said, ""let the buyer beware; you don't know if it's been inspected in the last year, or at all.""; On the other hand, when U.S.-registered vessels are inspected, O'Brien said, they are required to meet full Coast Guard standards, including expensive Type I life vests designed to be very easy to use.
But there are only two U.S.-flag vessels in the cruise trade -- American Hawaii Cruises' Independence and Constitution, operating in Hawaii.","""We're in a race with a catastrophe,"" says Alan Pollock of the National Transportation Safety Board on efforts to improve cruise ship safety.
He said a cruise ship disaster would create overwhelming pressure for new safety regulations, but he would rather take preventive action.
Safety experts are primarily concerned with fire protection, especially in the big new atrium ships, the ability of crewmembers to give safety instructions in a language that passengers understand and the aging of the world fleet of cruise ships.
Jim Bennett, chairman of the National Transportation and Safety Board said, ""The potential for loss of life is enormous.""","[[1775, 1818], [1833, 1848], [1850, 1899], [1901, 2047], [71, 78], [104, 160], [1410, 1547]]"
"But a unique subset has formed: people who like to do both at the same time.
And to help these folks along, companies arrange tours for marathon vacations.
The result?
Bangkok in November, London in April and Stockholm in May.; ""Skiers have mountain ranges, tennis players have resorts, why can't a runner take a marathon vacation?"" said Thorn Gilligan, president of Marathon Tours in Boston.
""A runner should be able to enjoy a closed city for a day.
It's a celebration for the sport as much as a competition.""; Gilligan took 5,500 people last year on 20 tours to countries from Bermuda to Moscow.
In addition to air fare and hotel, runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races such as the London Marathon.
Qualifying times are not required.; London, the most popular European city to visit, holds the world's largest marathon (April 12 next year).
Berlin's race (Sept. 27, 1992) has grown with the demise of the wall.; ""Most marathons take you through cities, so you get a chance to see things you'd never see on a sightseeing bus,"" said Fred Lebow, president of the New York

"Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash.
Along with getting seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel.
The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attending the Super Bowl.
And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.
Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs.
One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted.
If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 -- the going rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60.
Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a ""substantial and bona fide business discussion"" before, during or after the game, says Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc. To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block says.
And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient.
The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each.
""Even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it,"" says Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos.
Bibb is flying about 20 people -- mostly customers -- to the game.
""We get more earnings from the trip than the expense,"" says Mr. Foley.
Some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules.
A spokesman for Adolph Coors &amp; Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said its tax advisers instructed executives that ""this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business.""
Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game.
Meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed.
Under the old law, meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest.
Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-Super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law has a ""banquet meeting exception.""
Such meetings must have at least 40 persons, half of whom are away from home, and there must be a speaker.
Executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor, says William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Whinney.
If a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says.
One safety measure: Make a business-oriented speech, Mr. Block suggests.
He also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection.
That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests including business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers.
Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, says the bash is tax deductible because ""our sales people will be there and business will be discussed.""
He admits, however, ""We're not going to twist any arms.
We're there to say thank-you to those who've given us business.""
An IRS spokesman says more agents will be assigned to corporate audits of business-entertainment expenses this year.
But IRS enforcement of the rules could be as difficult as blocking the New York Giants' Lawrence Taylor.
""As a practical matter, as long as people say they talked business at a Super Bowl party, how can the IRS dispute it?"" says Vickie King, a Price Waterhouse tax official.
""The only people who will get into trouble are those who don't keep receipts.""","Businesses show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.

The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attending the Super Bowl.
And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.
Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs.
One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted.
If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 -- the going rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60.
Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a ""substantial and bona fide business discussion"" before, during or after the game, says Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc. To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block says.
And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient.
The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each.
""Even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it,"" says Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos.
Bibb is flying about 20 people -- mostly customers -- to the game.
""We get more earnings from the trip than the expense,"" says Mr. Foley.
Some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules.
A spokesman for Adolph Coors &amp; Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said its tax advisers instructed executives that ""this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business.""
Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game.
Meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed.
Under the old law, meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest.
Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-Super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law has a ""banquet meeting exception.""
Such meetings must have at least 40 persons, half of whom are away from home, and there must be a speaker.
Executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor, says William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Whinney.
If a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says.
One safety measure: Make a business-oriented speech, Mr. Block suggests.
He also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection.
That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests including business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers.
Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, says the bash is tax deductible because ""our sales people will be there and business will be discussed.""
He admits, however, ""We're not going to twist any arms.
We're there to say thank-you to those who've given us business.""
An IRS spokesman says more agents will be assigned to corporate audits of business-entertainment expenses this year.
But IRS enforcement of the rules could be as difficult as blocking the New York Giants' Lawrence Taylor.
""As a practical matter, as long as people say they talked business at a Super Bowl party, how can the IRS dispute it?"" says Vickie King, a Price Waterhouse tax official.
""The only people who will get into trouble are those who don't keep receipts.""","New, tougher tax laws on what can be claimed as business entertainment expense haven't slowed demand for tickets to Sunday's Super Bowl XXI.
Now, only 80% of the face value to tickets to sporting events can be deducted, and then only if a substantial business discussion occurs.
The face value of a 50-yard-line seat at the Super Bowl is $75, not $1500, the going rate.
Meals are 80% deductible if business is discussed.
Still, hundreds of companies will send their officials and customers to Pasadena for a weekend of partying.
The IRS will have difficulty disputing claims that business was discussed.","[[48, 62], [147, 153], [522, 619], [1641, 1699], [942, 968], [990, 1048], [1221, 1226], [1233, 1255], [1270, 1289], [1050, 1180], [2494, 2555], [63, 74], [335, 395], [419, 443], [4223, 4265], [4289, 4312]]"
"The Reagan administration may be willing to relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage if Congress agrees to dilute the legislation significantly, Labor Secretary William Brock indicated.
Mr. Brock said in an interview that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary for youths who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses.
He also said that Congress would have to drop plans to tie future rises in the minimum wage to the average wage for all non-supervisory private workers after 1990.
If Congress favors ""those positive components, we can sit down and talk about it,"" the secretary said.
But the administration will remain opposed to any broad minimum-wage boost that results in ""massive disemployment"" of young people, he added.
This is the first indication that the administration would be willing to bend its staunch resistance to any increase in the minimum wage, which hasn't risen for six years.
Earlier this week, during the Senate Labor Committee's first hearing on a bill to boost the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour in 1990 from the current $3.35, Mr. Brock reiterated his opposition to an increase.
He said boosting the level would worsen problems that many poorly educated, unskilled youths face in trying to find work in a more complex job market.
""I am increasingly convinced that a number of people . . .
are not only unemployed, but unemployable,"" Mr. Brock testified.
""I don't want to take a chance that we add to that problem"" by boosting the minimum wage and thereby pricing young people out of the job market.
In yesterday's interview, the secretary suggested the administration might accept a higher minimum wage, though perhaps smaller than in the pending bill, if Congress makes certain changes in the measure.
The administration has long supported a subminimum wage for youths, along with stressing the need for job-training and education programs.
Mr. Brock's suggestions for modifying the minimum-wage bill aren't likely to receive a warm welcome from congressional advocates for raising the minimum.
They say the wage level has lagged far behind the increased cost of living since 1981, seriously eroding low-paid workers' purchasing power.
Most House Labor Committee members oppose any youth subminimum wage, the small-business exemption has foundered in the past, and wage-indexing must stay in the bill, a staff official for the panel said.
Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Labor panel and co-author of the minimum-wage bill with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate committee, said that if Mr. Brock will put his ideas into a bill, the House committee will give it a hearing.
Currently, it's too early to talk compromise, Mr. Hawkins said.
But an aide to a Republican senator said: ""Everybody is aware of the possibility"" of a compromise.
""Many people feel that some kind of increase in the minimum wage is inevitable,"" he said, so an effort is afoot to see how Congress can ""do as little harm . . .
and as much good as possible,"" while boosting the wage level.
Some congressional labor experts said Mr. Brock personally would like to deal on Capitol Hill for a minimum-wage compromise.
One congressional staffer concluded: ""Apparently he's making some progress"" within the Reagan administration.","The Reagan Administration may relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage if Congress agrees to dilute the legislation significantly.
Labor Secretary Brock says it must exempt youths lacking entry-level job skills and drop plans for future raises.
Brock said that a number of people are not only unemployed but unemployable and that increasing the wage would add to the problem.
Rep Hawkins said that if Brock put his ideas into a bill it would be given a hearing.
But, he said, it's too early to talk compromise.
An aide to a Republican Senator said that many people feel that an increase in the wage is inevitable.","[[0, 29], [44, 158], [160, 175], [184, 189], [201, 215], [237, 331], [358, 370], [376, 412], [417, 429], [1330, 1419], [1456, 1508], [2406, 2427], [2587, 2609], [2615, 2684], [2697, 2748], [2754, 2790], [2850, 2871], [2885, 2900], [2909, 2927]]"
"In choosing federal Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, President Reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory -- and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the Senate.
The selection of the 60-year-old Judge Bork to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell gives the president his third Supreme Court appointment and by far his greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction.
The high court, with Justice Powell often the swing vote, has been narrowly divided for a number of years on volatile social issues, including upholding abortion and affirmative action.
But in Judge Bork, appointed by Mr. Reagan in 1982 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the president has picked a rare judicial -- rather than a political -- conservative, a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the Reagan administration's political agenda.
A scholar and formidable writer, the former Yale Law School professor has made his mark in antitrust law and a wide range of constitutional issues, urging judges to base their rulings on the intent of the framers of the Constitution.
However, judicial conservatives most often tend to reach conclusions that support conservative political views.
And liberal Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, fearful that Mr. Reagan's choice may upset the Supreme Court's moderate balance, have made clear they will fight any candidate whose views about the Constitution and the courts are too conservative.
Yesterday, Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Judiciary Committee member, lost no time urging that Judge Bork should be defeated.
""He stands for an extremist view of the Constitution and the role of the Supreme Court,"" Sen. Kennedy said.
""No justice would be better than this injustice.""
President Reagan announced his choice yesterday afternoon in the White House press room, lavishing praise on the nominee's intellectual abilities.
""Judge Bork, widely regarded as the most prominent and intellectually powerful advocate of judicial restraint, shares my views that judges' personal preferences and values should not be part of their constitutional interpretations,"" Mr. Reagan said.
He described Judge Bork, who stood next to him without comment, as an ""impressive legal mind"" and ""a premier constitutional authority.""
The announcement came just five days after Justice Powell announced his retirement, citing his health and the approach of his 80th birthday.
From the outset, Judge Bork was the clear front-runner to fill the vacancy, being favored by Attorney General Edwin Meese and his aides.
The only questions were whether to go with a younger conservative whose influence would last well into the next century and whether the strength of Judge Bork's conservative views would make his confirmation too difficult.
While the White House put aside the age issue, the confirmation process is likely to be a contentious one, both in the 14-member Senate Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor.
But the expectation, even among some Democrats, is that Judge Bork will be approved.
The initial skirmish is over when confirmation hearings will begin.
Committee Democrats say they don't expect to start hearings until September, raising questions about whether Judge Bork would be approved by the Supreme Court's opening next Oct. 5.
President Reagan urged the Senate ""to expedite its consideration""; his aides will push for a July start, although they aren't sure they will succeed.
The nomination presents a political problem for some Democrats.
Judge Bork is a difficult target, since his intellectual prowess is widely respected in legal circles, even by those who disagree with him.
Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, and Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, both presidential candidates, must satisfy liberal civil-rights groups that are already gearing up to battle the nomination and at the same time must avoid embarrassing themselves by using specious arguments, especially if the fight against Judge Bork proves futile.
The president's nominee to become the 104th justice is a bear of a man.
At 6 feet, over 200 pounds and rotund, with hair like a scouring pad and a beard to match, he is an imposing figure, made more so by his deep baritone voice.
An affable man, he occasionally grows impatient with lesser intellects and inefficiency.
His wife, Mary Ellen, a former nun, has been a calming influence, friends say, although also a very conservative one.
It is his second marriage.
His first wife, Clare, died of cancer in 1980, and he remarried in October 1982.
Judge Bork was at one time a cross-country skier and tennis player, and he recently resumed playing tennis out of apparent concern about his weight and general health.
But friends say his pursuits tend more to the intellectual.
He sometimes listens to books on tape while driving to work from his northwest Washington home, and while solicitor general in the Nixon administration, he pored over the New York Times crossword puzzle daily.
He does enjoy a good party and has on occasion been the one to close the bar.
At a solicitor general's office reunion in 1978, the dinner went some $250 over budget because Judge Bork kept the bar open well after the planned closing.
He first caught the eye of the legal community writing about antitrust law as a Yale Law School professor in the 1960s.
In 1971, he earned his reputation as an intellectual, conservative legal scholar with an article taking a narrow view of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.
In 1973, President Nixon tapped him to be solicitor general, the Justice Department official who represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court.
It was as solicitor general that in October 1973 he fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, after Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Mr. Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's order.
Judge Bork returned to Yale from 1977 to 1981 when he practiced law for a year before he was nominated for the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.
Mr. Richardson, now a Washington lawyer, defends Mr. Bork's actions.
Mr. Richardson says Mr. Bork considered resigning but that he urged him to remain for the stability of the Justice Department.
Nevertheless, Sen. Kennedy yesterday suggested that the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" will be an issue, saying the president ""should not be able to reach out of the muck of Irangate {and} reach into the muck of Watergate"" for a Supreme Court nominee.
But it is Judge Bork's prolific and forceful writings as a law professor and judge that have earned him his reputation as an intellectual leader of conservative legal thought for a generation of law school graduates.
And it is those views that will be scrutinized closely by the Senate.
""Unless Judge Bork can demonstrate to me that he comes to the court with an open mind, I would have some difficulty,"" said Sen. Biden at a press conference yesterday in Houston.
Many civil rights and women's groups reacted quickly against the nomination.
""There is tremendous potential for rolling back the gains we have made in civil rights and civil liberties over the past 30 years,"" said Judith Lichtman, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund.
And the AFL-CIO urged senators to refrain from endorsing Judge Bork until they can carefully review his record.
Once a New Deal liberal, Judge Bork became more conservative while at the University of Chicago.
There he studied economics under Aaron Director, a pioneer in applying economic logic to challenge a variety of theories and liberal beliefs.
In 1963, he wrote an article in the New Republic magazine challenging part of the proposed 1964 Civil Rights Act that would require desegregation of private facilities serving the public, such as lunch counters and hotels.
The law would impose the majority's morality on the minority, he said.
But in 1973, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee he had abandoned his view and fully supported the civil-rights law.
In 1968, in a Fortune magazine article, he was strongly critical of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, saying it ""is in the process of descending in national estimation from a position above the battle to the status of a political institution.""
The justices, he said, ""decide cases not according to the criteria they cite but according to their social and political sympathies.""
In that article, he described a landmark 1965 opinion recognizing a right to privacy that entitled married couples to use contraceptives in their home as ""shallow, murky and rhetorical"" and ""one more slogan that some justices will use . . .
in the process of writing their own tastes into the law.""
It was that 1965 ruling that was the basis for the Supreme Court's 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion, and Judge Bork's criticism of sexual privacy has caused alarm among women's groups over his nomination.
Indeed, in a 1984 appeals-court ruling, he declined to extend the right of sexual privacy to homosexual conduct and criticized the Supreme Court's record on privacy.
""If the revolution in sexual mores . . .
is in fact ever to arrive,"" he wrote, ""we think it must arrive through the moral choices of the people and their elected representatives, not through the judicial ukase of this court.""
But some friends and colleagues say his views don't mean that he would automatically vote to overrule the right to abortion.
""He is a true judicial conservative,"" says Dennis Hutchinson, a University of Chicago law professor, ""and that means judges are supposed to defer to the decisions of the legislature.""
Another hallmark of judicial conservatives is putting great weight on the importance of honoring precedents.
In a 1985 interview with District Lawyer magazine, he explained that he is more likely to stick to precedents in constitutional cases if so much legislation and so many other decisions have relied on them that ""they have become part of the structure of the nation.""
But he hasn't said how he would handle challenges to controversial precedents on which the Supreme Court is divided: abortion, affirmative action, school prayer and school busing, among others.
Judge Bork has been widely and sharply critical of the Supreme Court's 1964 decision establishing the principle of ""one person, one vote.""
His criticism is based largely on the view that it is purely a political issue that is best left to the legislatures to decide for themselves.
Views he expressed in 1971 in a series of lectures at Indiana University Law School argued that the First Amendment protects only speech expressly about government and politics.
But he has since modified his position, concluding ""that many other forms of discourse, such as moral and scientific debate, are central to democratic government and deserve protection.""
He excluded obscene and pornographic material from the First Amendment altogether.
As a judge, he has devoted much of his energy to questions of what are proper issues for courts to decide, taking a tough view on when a plaintiff has suffered sufficient injury to bring a lawsuit.
In a 1985 opinion, he argued against including sexual harassment as a form of job discrimination that is barred by the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
But in two 1984 cases, he cast votes giving a moderate reading to the free-speech and free-press clauses of the First Amendment.
In the antitrust field, he has argued long and effectively that the laws were only intended to regulate consumer welfare and weren't intended to protect smaller or less efficient companies from competition.
As a result, he has often opposed government efforts to block mergers that created conglomerates.
Those who know him expect he would be a powerful force at the Supreme Court, although he was sometimes slow and even bored with his work at the appeals court.
He isn't the kind of judge who invests a lot of time trying to lobby others to join him, but he hopes to persuade them with the force of his opinions, associates say.
If he gets to the Supreme Court, associates expect him to help form a strong conservative coalition.
He is a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist used to stay with Judge Bork on visits to Yale.","President Reagan named Judge Robert Bork, 60, as his replacement to the Supreme Court for retiring Justice Powell.
Bork faces a tough confirmation battle lead by liberal Senate Democrats.
Bork, a Yale Law School Professor in the 60's was appointed solicitor general in 1973 by President Nixon and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1982 by Reagan.
He earned a reputation as an intellectual leader of conservative legal thought through his prolific and forceful writings as a law professor and judge.
He believes strongly in precedent and a narrow judicial interpretation of law.","[[3, 11], [20, 77], [200, 271], [278, 284], [3, 11], [33, 37], [145, 184], [1251, 1268], [1406, 1416], [5293, 5295], [5371, 5411], [7128, 7129], [5586, 5645], [608, 703], [6596, 6668], [6679, 6760], [9903, 9943], [1955, 1985], [2033, 2063]]"
"If Robert Bork's Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week can be said to have had a moment of epiphany, it came Wednesday morning.
That is when Judge Bork was explaining to Sen. Alan Simpson how Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the famous civil libertarian, had once upheld a law that allowed the sterilization of the mentally retarded.
""Three generations of imbeciles are enough,"" Holmes had written, in what Judge Bork described, in charitable understatement, as ""not (Holmes's) finest hour.""
Sen. Simpson then paused for a moment, looked around at his colleagues, and quipped, ""Perhaps we ought to bring him back up here,"" and the hearing room broke up in laughter.
Sen. Simpson has a searing wit, but the unfunny truth is that, having written that phrase, even the eminent Justice Holmes would have trouble making it through the political swamp that passes for today's Senate confirmation process.
Justice Holmes would have spent much of his confirmation battle explaining how it was that he could hold such benighted views, and defending why he really wasn't prejudiced against the handicapped.
Judge Bork isn't Justice Holmes, though he is probably one of the half-dozen best qualified Supreme Court nominees since Holmes.
He is surely the most prolific, as well, and so the capital's standing army of activists and senators has this week been busily replaying everything he ever wrote or said, all in an attempt to prove he is a judicial extremist, a threat to the republic.
Judge Bork defended himself well this week, with scholarly precision and often with humor, but in Washington reasonableness alone is not enough to win a seat on the Court.
By now, the politics of judicial appointment in the Reagan years has become drearily predictable, like a Herblock cartoon.
Any nominee at all at odds with the judicial orthodoxy of recent decades is immediately attacked as someone out of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""
The essential weapons are, as Sen. Simpson put it in his opening statement, ""a deft blend of emotion, fear, guilt or racism.""
The idea is to raise such a public furor about the nominee's ""extremism"" that the fanatic moderates who often hold the balance of power in the Senate won't dare risk guilt by association by voting in favor.
If a nominee's reputation happens to be shredded amid all of this politicking, well, too bad, but that's life in the big city.
The activists started things off by supplying the emotion and fear.
A group known as ""People for the American Way"" papered Washington with ads headlining the case of ""Robert Bork vs. The People,"" suggesting, apparently, that anyone who supports Judge Bork opposes ""the people,"" not to mention the American way.
The same ads implied that Judge Bork had no objection to ""sterilizing workers,"" didn't believe in any right to privacy, and just might ""Turn the clock back on civil rights?""
The question mark was a nice touch, apparently meant to suggest the ad writers might actually have some doubt.
Once the hearings began, the directors of these lobbying groups huddled amid the marble colonnades in the back of the Senate Caucus Room, smiling or wincing as events played out.
Ralph Neas, the amiable leader of the activist troops and the subject of a flattering profile in Tuesday's Washington Post, was always ready with a quote.
""I think things are going well,"" he'd say, time and again.
""We're laying out the record that shows how extreme he is.""
The senators themselves were more respectful, perhaps because they know that TV cameras have been unkind lately to inquisitors.
Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden appeared to have taken a course from Miss Manners; he displayed none of the florid sarcasm that drove Ursula Meese to tears when her husband was seeking to be confirmed as attorney general.
The questioning, however, left little doubt about its goal -- to suggest that Judge Bork cares not at all for the rights of women, of minorities, of the press, or of pretty much anyone else.
Hadn't Judge Bork done something ""illegal,"" charged Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, by dismissing the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973?
Judge Bork explained -- as he has dozens of times before -- his moral dilemma in seeking as solicitor general to follow the orders of a president, yet also keep the special prosecutor team from disbanding.
He succeeded on both accounts, as the special prosecution force's own final report concluded.
Isn't Judge Bork beyond the pale, implied Sen. Biden, for believing there is no right to privacy in the Constitution?
Judge Bork had to explain that, yes, there are all kinds of privacy rights in the Constitution (the First, 4th and 5th amendments, for example), but he didn't believe there is any ""generalized, undefined"" right.
Isn't Judge Bork in effect a racist because he once opposed that part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlawed discrimination in public places?
implied Sen. Edward Kennedy.
Judge Bork explained that he was concerned at the time about government coercion in private decisions, but that he had retracted that position more than a decade ago.
So Americans were left with the spectacle of this distinguished judge and scholar having to plead in public that he is not a bigot, that, indeed, he had once persuaded the senior partners in his Chicago law firm to end their quota on Jewish attorneys.
Judge Bork's supporters in the White House believe that all of this helped his cause, that it proved he wasn't, as one put it, ""a neanderthal.""
They believe he has improved his chances to win the support of at least one of the three undecided senators on the Judiciary Committee, and thus make it at least to the Senate floor.
If Judge Bork is not confirmed, however, the record of this week suggests that the reason will result less from his own failings than from the ferocity and distortions of his opponents.
-- Mr. Gigot is a writer on the Journal's editorial page.","Senators this week have been busy attempting to prove that Judge Robert Bork, President Reagan's nominee to the Supreme Court, is a judicial extremist, a threat to the republic.
They are replaying anything controversial that he ever wrote or said.
Further, they are aided by activists who claim Bork does not support the rights of women, minorities, the press and other groups.
One group, ""People for the American Way"" suggests that anyone who supports Bork opposes ""the people.""
Senators of the judiciary committee are following these lobbyists lead in their questioning.
Bork defended himself well, with scholarly precision and often humor.","[[2457, 2666], [1232, 1402], [2389, 2455], [2700, 2873], [3438, 3482], [3566, 3594], [3785, 3974], [1485, 1574], [1325, 1483], [1485, 1495], [1709, 1715]]"
"Bank of Boston Corp.'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say.
Domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans.
U.S. banks are increasingly splitting into two groups.
On one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries.
On the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as Bank of Boston decided Monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible.
""It's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out,"" says Lawrence Cohn, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
The Bank of Boston decision ""may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks,"" adds James J. McDermott, Jr., director of research at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks.
""It's created an enormous quandary for many money-center banks,"" Mr. McDermott says.
Actions such as that taken by Bank of Boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks.
Management could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks.
The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said.
While the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as Bank of Boston, they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations.
Earlier this year, Bank of Boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a $6 billion bank loan for Mexico, according to New York bankers.
Now that Bank of Boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less-developed countries, it's likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts.
That could add to the lending burden for the biggest U.S. banks.
Moreover, most of the nation's big banks couldn't afford to follow Bank of Boston's lead without crippling their capital, and reducing their common equity-asset ratios to unacceptably low levels.
For instance, if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, Keefe Bruyette estimates.
In order to take steps similar to Bank of Boston's, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that.
Yesterday, Manufacturers Hanover announced a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share, offering investors a yield of more than 13% annually.
Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston's action.
Other large New York banks also declined to disclose their plans, although a spokeman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said, ""We're obviously looking at it.""
Mellon Bank Corp. said yesterday that it expects a fourth-quarter loss of about $220 million, and that it would increase loan-loss reserves by about $180 million to cover troubled foreign loans.
The stocks of several major money-center banks fell sharply yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Chase Manhattan skidded $2.25 to close at $20.125, Manufacturers Hanover fell $2.375 to $24.25, and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. was off $1.50 to $30.
Bank of Boston closed up 50 cents at $20.75, while Mellon fell $1 to $26.25.
Analysts expect that other regional banks may copy the action taken by Bank of Boston.
""I wouldn't be surprised if some of the medium-sized regionals decided to follow,"" said Cheryl Swaim, an analyst and vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
In Boston, there were rumors Bank of New England might announce a similar move, but a company spokesman said ""reserve levels are appropriate.""
Bank of Boston announced Monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the Third World on a non-accrual basis.
When a loan is placed on non-accrual, a bank only credits interest it actually receives, and doesn't automatically accrue interest due.
Bank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade.
Along with $330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual, Bank of Boston has now either charged off, or put on non-accrual, all of its $1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries.
This doesn't include $170 million in trade-related debt.
While Bank of Boston's action is the most striking to date to remove Latin exposure from its balance sheet, smaller similar actions began at other banks around mid-year.
First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, the nation's 15th biggest banking concern, charged off $25.4 million in troubled foreign loans during the third quarter.
First Chicago Corp., the 11th largest banking concern, charged off $48.9 million in Third World loans during the quarter.
And even before the big reserves were set aside, banks were quietly charging off Latin debt, though on a smaller scale.
Last March, Continental Illinois Corp. said it had charged off about half of its $100 million of loans to Peru.
Continental wouldn't comment yesterday on Bank of Boston's action.

Source: Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. (Revised WSJ Dec. 22, 1987)","Bank of Boston Corp.'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions.
Domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans.
While large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as Bank of Boston, they also want to ensure that regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations.","[[0, 160], [188, 385], [387, 523], [1932, 2023], [2025, 2116]]"
"Bank of Boston Corp.'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say.
Domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans.
U.S. banks are increasingly splitting into two groups.
On one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries.
On the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as Bank of Boston decided Monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible.
""It's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out,"" says Lawrence Cohn, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
The Bank of Boston decision ""may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks,"" adds James J. McDermott, Jr., director of research at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks.
""It's created an enormous quandary for many money-center banks,"" Mr. McDermott says.
Actions such as that taken by Bank of Boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks.
Management could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks.
The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said.
While the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as Bank of Boston, they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations.
Earlier this year, Bank of Boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a $6 billion bank loan for Mexico, according to New York bankers.
Now that Bank of Boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less-developed countries, it's likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts.
That could add to the lending burden for the biggest U.S. banks.
Moreover, most of the nation's big banks couldn't afford to follow Bank of Boston's lead without crippling their capital, and reducing their common equity-asset ratios to unacceptably low levels.
For instance, if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, Keefe Bruyette estimates.
In order to take steps similar to Bank of Boston's, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that.
Yesterday, Manufacturers Hanover announced a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share, offering investors a yield of more than 13% annually.
Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston's action.
Other large New York banks also declined to disclose their plans, although a spokeman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said, ""We're obviously looking at it.""
Mellon Bank Corp. said yesterday that it expects a fourth-quarter loss of about $220 million, and that it would increase loan-loss reserves by about $180 million to cover troubled foreign loans.
The stocks of several major money-center banks fell sharply yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Chase Manhattan skidded $2.25 to close at $20.125, Manufacturers Hanover fell $2.375 to $24.25, and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. was off $1.50 to $30.
Bank of Boston closed up 50 cents at $20.75, while Mellon fell $1 to $26.25.
Analysts expect that other regional banks may copy the action taken by Bank of Boston.
""I wouldn't be surprised if some of the medium-sized regionals decided to follow,"" said Cheryl Swaim, an analyst and vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
In Boston, there were rumors Bank of New England might announce a similar move, but a company spokesman said ""reserve levels are appropriate.""
Bank of Boston announced Monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the Third World on a non-accrual basis.
When a loan is placed on non-accrual, a bank only credits interest it actually receives, and doesn't automatically accrue interest due.
Bank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade.
Along with $330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual, Bank of Boston has now either charged off, or put on non-accrual, all of its $1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries.

U.S. banks are split into two groups: large, money-center banks with thin reserves against Third World loans, which hope of collect on these loans, and smaller, regional institutions, with few Third World loans, which establish big reserves or declare such loans uncollectable.
If the major banks were to follow the regionals' lead, they could dangerously reduce common equity/assets ratio levels, some far below the 4% accepted as prudent.","[[88, 119], [147, 160], [4523, 4627], [0, 31], [4417, 4441], [4449, 4522], [523, 537], [551, 576], [591, 599], [617, 640], [655, 668], [746, 767], [775, 829], [829, 868], [888, 890], [929, 977], [669, 676], [683, 712], [1033, 1071], [2641, 2709], [1986, 2023], [2515, 2603], [2686, 2709]]"
"Japanese workers at U.S. Navy bases are protesting a policy that requires workers who deal with confidential matters to submit to lie-detector tests.
""The plan neglects our basic human rights,"" said Misao Kamiyama, chairman of the All Japanese Garrison Forces Labor Union, which represents 1,200 workers at the U.S. bases.
The union asked the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which hires Japanese workers for the bases, to urge the U.S. to drop the polygraph requirement.
""In Japan, only criminals get that kind of treatment,"" Mr. Kamiyama said.
""We are planning a full-scale nationwide protest against the decision"" if the agency doesn't respond by today.
The Navy briefed the workers on the tests in April.
Mr. Kamiyama said about 500 Japanese were asked to sign an agreement to take a polygraph examination and were ""threatened to be transferred to other sections if they refuse to sign.""
The accuracy of polygraph tests is widely disputed.
An agency spokesman said it consented to the U.S. plan but expressed concern about the ""human-rights standpoint"" of polygraph tests.
The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, didn't elaborate.
The agency acts as liaison between the U.S. military in Japan and the Japanese government.
Under the plan, only employees at Navy plants would have to take the tests.
Since September 1987, the Navy has been requiring the polygraph test before it grants ""limited-access authorization,"" to personnel, a U.S. military spokesman said.
About 500 Japanese base workers are subject to the lie-detector test, the spokesman said.
Most work at ship-repair facilities in Yokosuka and Sasebo.
Mr. Kamiyama said transfers of employees who refused to take the tests could fuel anti-American sentiment.","The Defense Facility Administration Agency hires Japanese workers at United States bases, and acts as liaison between the Japanese government and the United States military.
Since September 1987 the Navy has been telling employees that they would be required to take polygraph tests before getting ""limited access authorization"".
Last month the Navy explained the requirement, and the workers are now protesting it as an invasion of their privacy.
The Navy is threatening to transfer those who refuse the polygraph, and the Japanese Garrison Forces Union that represents the workers, say they will mount a nation-wide protest.","[[311, 321], [339, 383], [385, 427], [1156, 1208], [1218, 1245], [9, 35], [666, 707], [1323, 1440], [9, 16], [36, 59], [86, 116], [160, 191], [666, 716], [235, 259], [266, 271], [273, 289], [296, 303], [556, 573], [585, 603], [666, 674], [790, 806], [823, 857], [876, 890]]"

Mr. Attalla claims that his work with Cory is no gravy train.
In the suit, he says that under the owners' agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- Cory.
So far, Mr. Attalla says, he's spent over $125,000, the amount sought in damages.
In return, he is entitled to all ribbons and awards.
The Remondis are in charge of caring for the dog.
Despite the retirement, the suit says, the Remondis showed Cory twice recently.
(He placed fourth and then didn't place at all.)
For now, a judge's order temporarily bars them from further shows.
In a memo filed in court, Mr. Remondi claims that Mr. Attalla retired the dog ""simply and solely to better"" the chances that Mr. Attalla's agent would win with a rival Rover.
The Remondis also say Mr. Attalla has bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog.
They claim that Mr. Attalla has breached the pact by not paying certain expenses.

"Putting John Sununu and Ted Kennedy to work on a problem is like putting two scorpions in a bottle.
Mr. Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, is a combative, conservative Republican with a history of ambushing liberal Democrats like Sen. Kennedy.
Yet Mr. Sununu has just finished going head to head with the Massachusetts senator -- and succeeding in negotiating an agreement on landmark legislation giving sweeping new rights to disabled Americans.
Mr. Sununu was typically tough; at one point, he tracked down Sen. Kennedy on a boat for a blunt phone conversation to break a logjam in Senate-White House talks.
Another White House negotiating session ran triple its scheduled length.
In the end Mr. Sununu committed the White House's support to the legislation while winning some concessions to minimize the effects on small business -- and a mutually acceptable bill now is whisking through Congress.
""His role on that {legislation} was really impressive, an impressive tour de force,"" Sen. Kennedy says.
""Once he got involved, we were able to identify the key issues.""
As that encounter suggests, Mr. Sununu, the brainy former New Hampshire governor, has begun thriving in Washington even though his brusque style still rubs some people the wrong way.
His boss, President Bush, is enjoying high public approval, important legislation is moving ahead and Mr. Sununu's relationship with the president is strong.
Inside the administration, aides say Mr. Sununu has grown more relaxed, more willing to delegate responsibility and surprisingly content to play the role of a detached broker in policy debates.
This represents a significant change from the administration's rocky opening months, when some wondered whether the new chief of staff would survive.
Mr. Sununu was pilloried as John Tower's nomination as defense secretary went down in flames, as an ill-advised idea to charge fees on savings and loan deposits blew up in the administration's face and as the process of filling government jobs bogged down.
Many political analysts here believe that Mr. Sununu has moderated his brash style, and that the former governor has adjusted to his White House role.
But the relentlessly self-confident Mr. Sununu claims that it is Washington that has changed -- that the rest of the city has accustomed itself to the deliberate pace that Mr. Bush chose for tackling thorny problems like the savings-and-loan mess, air pollution and arms talks with the Soviets.
""I think this administration takes pains to work hard to make sure the whole is built up of a lot of pieces done in exactly the right way,"" Mr. Sununu says.
He likens the Bush style to the process of forming a mosaic by carefully putting in place small parts one at a time.
""I hope the good feelings that are out there now are reflective of the fact that people are beginning to appreciate that the pieces are coming together,"" he says.
Mr. Sununu was a hard-charging governor who ran the New Hampshire statehouse with an iron hand, earning Mr. Bush's trust when he engineered a crucial victory in the 1988 New Hampshire primary.
But despite the initial fears of some in Washington, Mr. Sununu insists, he has carefully avoided using his powerful new post to be a ""gatekeeper"" who blocks others from the president.
Indeed, cabinet members and other advisers have enjoyed unusually broad access to the president.
Moreover, Mr. Sununu is proving more adept than expected at reining in his personal views and instead brokering compromises among other advisers.
In the last stages of preparing Mr. Bush's mammoth Clean Air Act proposals, for instance, Mr. Sununu called together Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly and White House staffers for a marathon meeting to craft a compromise settling a dispute over regulations to cut auto emissions.
Mr. Reilly recalls that in a private chat later, Mr. Sununu, an engineer in his own right, disclosed that he still harbored reservations about one small piece of the bill but had chosen not to push his personal view.
""We're not preparing this legislation for you or for me.
It's for him {Mr. Bush},"" Mr. Sununu explained.
Adds Mr. Reilly: ""Contrary to what some people had feared, that he would simply impose his own view because he's a strong man, I don't have the sense that he did that.""
Despite such deft internal maneuvering, though, some Democrats and Republicans alike suspect Mr. Sununu, with his combative style, still may be accumulating too many enemies for his own good.
This was particularly evident during the Tower debacle, when Mr. Sununu privately lashed out at Sam Nunn, the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who led the fight against Sen. Tower, threatening to sour the administration's relations with this critical lawmaker.
And although the White House chief of staff has toned down since that early encounter, in a recent meeting with GOP House members, Mr. Sununu suggested that Republicans attack a crime package proposed by Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware -- chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- as ""mostly plagiarism,"" because it allegedly stole ideas from Mr. Bush's plans.
The charge offended Sen. Biden, whose presidential campaign last year collapsed amid charges that he had plagiarized speeches.
The senator was particularly rankled because he carefully backed up his crime plan with a 50-page appendix crediting others with many of the ideas.
Mr. Sununu's charges reportedly led to an acrimonious telephone confrontation between the two men, who refuse to discuss the episode.
But Sen. Biden does say that when Mr. Sununu has ""substantive differences"" with someone, ""the inclination is to respond with personal attacks -- which is bush league, no pun intended.
It surprised me.""
Mr. Sununu also rankled some Republican congressional leaders by dressing them down at a recent White House meeting for failing to properly support Mr. Bush's programs.
And a group of conservative supporters was stunned at another meeting when one conservative began raising a concern about personnel issues, only to be cut short by Mr. Sununu, who snapped: ""Get your facts straight.""
Mr. Sununu suggests that sometimes when he knocks heads he does so because it's part of the job of being the top aide to a president who doesn't like to knock heads himself.
""There are natural obligations that I have to be willing to carry out,"" he says.
""It goes with the territory.""
One group Mr. Sununu has generally succeeded in pleasing is conservatives, who view him as their champion in a generally moderate White House.
Mr. Sununu does appear ready to move in when he thinks conservative principles aren't being followed adequately.
When the Supreme Court rendered its controversial decision curbing abortion rights, for instance, lower-ranking staffers recommended that the White House avoid commenting on the politically explosive decision.
But Mr. Sununu rejected that advice, ordered up a lengthy statement reiterating Mr. Bush's opposition to abortion, then read the statement personally to reporters.
And whatever his relations with others, Mr. Sununu's most important relationship -- the one with President Bush -- appears sturdy.
Mr. Sununu is confident enough, for example, to weigh in on foreign-policy as well as domestic issues.
He acknowledges arguing that Mr. Bush should propose even deeper cuts in U.S. and Soviet conventional forces than those he ultimately proposed this spring.
And Mr. Sununu is comfortable enough with Mr. Bush to pull an occasional practical joke.
The other day, Mr. Sununu and two other advisers were sitting in front of Mr. Bush's desk waiting for the president.
It occurred to Mr. Sununu that the sight of three aides staring at an empty presidential chair was reminiscent of the Doonesbury cartoon strip that lampoons Mr. Bush by portraying him as a transparent wisp of air.
So he had a White House photographer snap a shot of the scene, later inscribed the picture accordingly and gave it to Mr. Bush -- who was so amused he immediately hurried to the White House press room to show it off.","John Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, is a combative, conservative Republican.
Although his brusque style rubs some people the wrong way the brainy former New Hampshire governor is now given credit for acting as a detached broker in policy debates.
This represents a striking change from the administration's opening months when many wondered if the chief of staff would survive.
Many political analysts believe Sununu has moderated his brash style, but he insists that it is Washington that has changed.
Nevertheless, some Democrats and Republicans alike believe that Sununu with his combative style may still be accumulating too many enemies for his own good.","[[8, 19], [112, 184], [1196, 1257], [1116, 1156], [1554, 1609], [1611, 1673], [1680, 1726], [1731, 1759], [2018, 2041], [2047, 2059], [2064, 2100], [2209, 2261], [4360, 4404], [4409, 4502]]"
"The mass emigration of thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys.
No one is predicting a date for a possible reunification.
Proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of East Bloc reform trends, and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to Washington and Moscow.
Yet growing signs of ferment in East Germany have given Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government reason to consider the possibilities.
Eduard Lintner, parliamentary speaker on German affairs for the joint Christian Democrat and Christrian Socialist caucus in the Bundestag, said his committee has placed reunification on its October agenda.
He said the sessions, which will include government officials and outside experts, hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with West Germany's Western allies, particularly the U.S.
""It has become clear to the world that the Communist system in East Germany is in trouble,"" Mr. Lintner said.
""The time has come for us to show our allies, but also reform-minded people in the East, that German reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about.""
""There are still a number of imponderables,"" Mr. Linter conceded.
""For instance, we want the federal government to approach our allies and get their thoughts on the reunification topic.""
The U.S. ambassador to Bonn, Vernon A. Walters, earlier this month reaffirmed Washington's policy of supporting a German reunification based on free, democratic elections.
But Mr. Walters caused a stir by predicting that reunion could occur in the relatively near future.
Emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany has raised questions on how long East Berlin's leaders can resist the democratic reforms sweeping through neighboring East Bloc countries.
Reforms in Poland, Hungary and even the Soviet Union have magnified East Germany's Stalinist controls.
Fledgling protest groups, and the influential Protestant church, have begun pressing for reforms in East Germany which, if allowed to include free elections, could eventually lead to a reunited Germany, according to some Western experts.
Dorothee Wilms, Bonn's cabinet minister for inter-German affairs, said in an interview in the newspaper Welt am Sonntag that recent polls show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunifed Germany.
""The desire for reunification, a feeling of togetherness, a sense of nationhood -- all this has strongly increased in recent years,"" Ms. Wilms told the newspaper.
""The recent escape movement from the DDR makes especially clear that people of both German states want to live free amongst themselves,"" she said, but cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight.
The first step, she added, ""is the reform process in the DDR.""
Most West German governments since 1949 have paid only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of West Germany's constitution.
Political realities have prevented the topic from becoming a serious issue.
Analysts say that four decades of different systems would make reunification difficult.
Further, many West German workers worry that a mass influx of East Germans could threaten their jobs.
Thousands of East Germans have emigrated to West Germany over the Austro-Hungarian border since Budapest ignored East Berlin's protests and opened its border.
Close to 80,000 East German refugees have arrived in West Germany so far this year, either legally or by escaping, and a total of more than 100,000 are expected by December.
The Soviets have joined East Berlin in criticizing Bonn for welcoming the East German refugees, and chided Hungary for violating an emigration treaty with East Germany by allowing them to leave.
Moscow, which has tolerated reforms elsewhere in the East Bloc, is said to be concerned by conditions in East Germany, perhaps the most important of its Warsaw Pact satellites.
Unconfirmed West German intelligence reports appearing in the West German media said Moscow fears a growing dissident movement and mass demonstrations in East Germany by next year.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev accepted an invitation to attend East Germany's 40th anniversary celebration, providing an opportunity for serious discussions with Erich Honecker, East Berlin's ailing party leader.
East Germany's Communist leadership, commented the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, ""has no illusions as to why Gorbachev is honoring their 40th anniversary.
He certainly will not say 'well done, keep it up.'""","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc have magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.

"""Las Vegas is an accident waiting to happen,"" says David Shulman, a Salomon Brothers economist who tracks real estate markets.
""The only reason Las Vegas has been booming is because it was on the periphery of Southern California.
Now, that's stopped and things are bound to change.""
Exciting new projects and aggressive marketing could help the casinos goose their gambling numbers for a while -- barring a shooting war in the Mideast that plays havoc with fuel supplies.
But the same can't be said in the housing industry, where out-of-state wealth has fueled growth over the past decade.
As a city that thrived on the free-spending ways of others, Las Vegas was made for the 1980s.
It grew up during those years from a purely gambling town to a destination resort attracting families and conventioneers.
While gamblers spent money wildly, builders transformed the Las Vegas valley's dirt roads, rock and sand into a carpet of housing developments, man-made ponds and golf courses.
Jobs, crisp desert air and the cheap cost of living lured immigrants from around the country, and the population nearly doubled, to 780,000 residents from fewer than 450,000.
""We are now a mature and diverse community that just doesn't have the same reliance on casino gaming as it once did,"" boasts Don Haze, a commercial real estate broker who opened a Coldwell Banker commercial leasing office in 1981.
But a lengthy downturn could undo some of the image-building that Las Vegas underwent in the 1980s.
""You must remember that the people who have been successful in this town have always had their feet on the gas pedal,"" says R. Keith Schwer, of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's Center for Business and Economic Research.
When the city was hit by the recession of 1981, tourism spending grew a little less than 1%, though visitor volume posted a slight decline.
""The movers and shakers have not been conditioned to deal with great economic downturns,"" Mr. Schwer says.
The recession in the early '80s spurred city leaders to mount a campaign to help Las Vegas break out of its dependency on the casino industry.
In 1983, the Nevada state Legislature passed a law permitting interstate banking that led Citibank to move its credit card distribution center to Las Vegas.
Today, 2,000 people work there.
By contrast, the city's huge new Mirage casino employs about 7,000.
But almost no major companies have followed Citibank's lead.
The Nevada Development Authority estimates that in the past two years only 3,103 new jobs were created by private sector firms either expanding or moving into Nevada.
As a result, experts say, the economy still lacks the diversity that would help it weather another prolonged downturn.
Still, Las Vegas isn't Phoenix, and there haven't been any billion-dollar thrift seizures or distressed land sales yet.
Even the most pessimistic economists expect Nevada's population growth to remain healthy.
What's more, the national credit crunch has saved developers from building projects with no prospect of success.
""What we need to do now is take a few deep breaths,"" says Donald Snyder, chairman and chief executive of First Interstate Bank of Nevada, a unit of First Interstate Bancorp and Nevada's biggest bank.
Las Vegas does have excesses that are uniquely its own.
Huge new Disney-like facilities such as the 3,000-room Mirage and the 4,000-room Excalibur have forced the industry into a Darwinian struggle in which older, undercapitalized facilities are falling behind more modern competitors.
""The strong will survive,"" says Golden Nugget's chairman, Stephen Wynn, whose $710 million Mirage continues to lure crowds from neighboring casinos.
""But I am worried about some of our competitors.
You can't just build boxes, rent out the rooms and get by anymore.""
Size is no indicator of success, either.
Bally Manufacturing Corp., one of the nation's biggest gambling companies, has defaulted on its casino debt, and it has trimmed its staff by 600 workers.
Other big names have also hit cold streaks.
At Hilton Hotels Corp., high-roller competition from the Mirage and Caesars Palace has cut into operating profit, which fell 50% in the third quarter.
Now Hilton, Nevada's biggest employer, plans to trim operating costs -- and staff -- in Las Vegas by about 8%.
Altogether, that means layoffs of more than 500.
Other once-proud Las Vegas names have been tarnished by closings and bankruptcy filings.
The Landmark hotel and casino shut its doors earlier this year; the Aladdin has filed for bankruptcy protection and is slated for auction.
Meanwhile, aging casinos like the Dunes and the Stardust have struggled to keep pace.
And even before the town has recovered from the one-two punch of the Excalibur and Mirage, the industry faces another challenge from MGM Grand Inc.'s Kirk Kerkorian, who has vowed to forge ahead with plans for a 5,000-room megafacility.
Add to that the Riviera's 1,600-room new wing, the Stardust's additional 1,200 rooms and dozens of other projects on the boards, and further fallout appears certain.
""It's what I call the rule of 500,"" says Alan Pomerantz, a real estate attorney with Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in New York City.
""If a city projects a need for 500 hotel rooms, then 500 developers will build 500 hotels each with 500 rooms.""
The rule of 500 appears to apply to residential developers, as well.
While the twin engines of Las Vegas's housing growth -- the casino industry and the spillover from the California market -- are beginning to sputter, housing starts continue to climb.
Over the next year, builders have applied for permits to put up more than 49,000 housing units in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.
Tight credit could keep as many as 30% from being built, says Glen Barton of the Meyers Group, a market research company based in Los Angeles.
But that would still leave 34,000 new homes and apartments to absorb.
Economists cite another disturbing trend in Las Vegas's growth pattern: A full 8.1% of all payroll workers are in the construction sector, suggesting that there aren't enough indigenous industries to pick up the slack once things quiet down.
And home buying has begun to taper off.
According to the Meyers Group, the number of home sales in the third quarter dropped 27.3% from a year earlier, while the inventory of unsold homes was up 15.4%.
Consider the case of Leon Cohen, a 75-year-old former real estate broker from Encino, Calif.
He cashed in on the California real estate boom last year and moved to the serenity of the Nevada desert, where he lives in Del Webb Corp.'s Sun City, a planned community.
As a retiree and former Californian, Mr. Cohen is the type of resident Las Vegas planners dreamed of when they imagined an economy freed from the cyclical whims of the gambling industry.
But there may not be many Leon Cohens left.
""With the California real estate market going down, I'm sure I couldn't have made my deal today,"" he says.
""I was lucky things went so well in California when they did.""
Some development companies are betting that any slowdown will be brief and are plunging ahead with ambitious projects.
One is a 25-village city-within-a-city called Summerlin, developed by Howard Hughes Properties.
Designed on 39 square miles of property, the project won't be completed until early next century.
Construction has already begun on Lake Las Vegas, a $3.5 billion project bankrolled by the Bass brothers on 2,200 desert acres.
""We all know there'll be a slowdown here, just like there's going to be one everywhere,"" says Coldwell Banker's Mr. Haze.
""But they used to say that when California got a cold, Las Vegas got pneumonia.
Now I think when California gets its cold, we just might only get a case of sniffles.""","Las Vegas grew up in the 1980s from a purely gambling town to a destination resort attracting families and conventioneers.
While the gambling industry boomed, builders transformed the Las Vegas valley into housing developments attracting residents from around the country almost doubling the population.
Now the regional economy is beginning to slow.
Many casinos have been laying off workers while thousands of new hotel rooms are being constructed.
David Shulman, a Solomon Brothers economist said that ""Las Vegas is an accident waiting to happen.""
Efforts have been made to keep Las Vegas from depending so heavily on the gambling industry by permitting interstate banking but those efforts have not been too successful.","[[650, 659], [669, 682], [687, 694], [714, 804], [163, 170], [365, 373], [514, 522], [806, 811], [841, 882], [928, 948], [1035, 1040], [1057, 1075], [1077, 1095], [1103, 1110], [1123, 1137], [4173, 4176], [5489, 5498], [6057, 6060], [6667, 6675], [6728, 6735], [7054, 7062], [3657, 3664], [3940, 3961], [4212, 4225], [4249, 4254], [4307, 4314], [4435, 4440], [4445, 4451], [4618, 4622], [4830, 4856], [4921, 4924], [4963, 4968], [1, 94], [2034, 2102], [2130, 2148], [2155, 2184], [2361, 2404]]"

Frank T. Iorio Mamaroneck, N.Y. ---
As a life member of the National Rifle Association, I agree with Mr. Gartner -- it is not too much to ask for a nationwide ""seven-day `cooling-off' period"" (the Brady Bill) to give the authorities time for background checks.
As a law-abiding citizen, it would be of comfort to know that other potential handgun buyers would be screened and keep those with a criminal past from owning a handgun.
The reason Washington has yet to enact serious gun-control laws is due to the enormous voting and financial pressure of the pro-gun lobby.
While Congress is congratulating itself on how well it acted during the vote on the Persian Gulf war, more than 100 body bags were filled here in the U.S. due to handgun violence.
The NRA has not acted prudently and is alienating the support and respect of many legislators, police departments and its members.
James Forbes Atlanta --- It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun.
Mr. Gartner has now made it abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society.
I find it incongruous that the president of NBC News, a man who should believe in the broadening of constitutional rights, obviously has no regard for the Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms.
I am sure that if there were a movement to narrow and restrict the First Amendment freedoms of the press, he would be at the forefront of the opposition.
Mr. Gartner ignores the key issues regarding suicide and crime.
The problem is not the instrument used to kill oneself or someone else.
The problems are the breakdown of the family (black and white); an education system that fails to educate; poverty; illegal drugs, and emasculated police, justice and penal systems.
This has been the message preached by the NRA for years.
As evidenced by New York City and Washington, which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abiding citizens, Mr. Gartner's placebo doesn't work because it ignores the root causes of suicide and crime.
Richard W. Bonds Cordova, Tenn. --- Mr. Gartner should have read The Federalist No. 46 by James Madison before he wrote his anti-gun diatribe.
If he had, he would understand that the constitutional guarantee of uninfringed firearms possession is for protection against tyranny.
It has nothing to do with duck hunting or target shooting.
Furthermore, Madison makes it clear that state militias, by the fact of their being organized, would give private arms their greatest effectiveness in the resistance to tyranny.
Otherwise, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, ""the citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.""
Thus the ""well-organized militia"" phrase in the Second Amendment was not intended to restrict arms to those in the militia -- as the anti-gun lobby would have us believe.
When we realize that the individual right to keep and bear arms is our ultimate defense against tyranny, all of the arguments about magazine capacity, armor-piercing bullets, sporting use, etc. suddenly stand before us in their naked falsity.

"The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test, which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin, might suggest a new ""risk factor"" for heart attacks.
About half of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year don't have the known risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, obesity and high blood pressure.
It is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who don't suffer heart attacks.
The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital.
""In our hands, it cost about $40 and in other labs it may cost the patient $40 to $80,"" he said.
Dr. Laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test, which was developed by his wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey.
The test, which isn't patented, is available in kit form to laboratories.
The blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is.
The release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure.
The urine portion of the test tells how much salt is in the bloodstream.
A high concentration of salt in the blood also raises pressure.
The test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises, tending to boost blood pressure, the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt.
The new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by Dr. Laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack.
The theory has provoked sometimes furious controversy for almost 20 years.
The Cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood.
Such ""high renin"" people are at a high risk of a heart attack.
On the other hand, in other patients with high blood pressure, the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood.
These ""low renin"" people are at a low risk of heart attack, Dr. Laragh has maintained.
In the experiment, blood and urine samples were obtained at New York City offices and factories from 1,717 workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure.
The patients' high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by Michael H. Alderman and his colleagues at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who operate a work-site blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions.
In 1981, Dr. Laragh's group began testing the renin activity in blood and urine samples collected by Dr. Alderman's team.
They kept track of the workers for more than eight years to see which had heart attacks.
The results, published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, lend strong support to Dr. Laragh's theory.
Only 12% of the patients had high renin ""profiles.""
But the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients, 13 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years of observation.
The incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile -- 5.3 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years -- and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile, 3.3 per 1,000 person-years, Drs.
Alderman, Laragh and their respective colleagues reported.
Regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups, those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks.
Smokers had more heart attacks than nonsmokers, but the incidence of attacks in smokers with high renin profiles was more than six times that in smokers with low renin profiles.
""But the real dynamite is in the patients who didn't have any of the usual risk factors,"" Dr. Laragh said in an interview.
Among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes, ""those with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction {heart attack} than those with normal or low renin profiles,"" the researchers wrote.
There were no heart attacks among the 240 patients with low renin profiles who had no risk factors other than high blood pressure.
To Dr. Laragh, this suggests that a high renin profile might signal a high risk of heart attack even for people without high blood pressure.
""We think everybody should have this simple and accurate test,"" he said in the interview.
""It's a new window into heart disease.""
In an accompanying editorial, Victor J. Dzau of Stanford University medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is ""potentially useful"" in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack.
But, he wrote, ""a larger, population-based study will be important in confirming the results of this paper.""
The experiment has implications for drug makers as well as patients.
Apparently by coincidence, Abbott Laboratories announced on Tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin.
Other major drug makers are thought to also be working on renin inhibitors.
The experiment hints these drugs might also protect patients from heart attacks.
A big-selling class of high blood pressure drugs, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp.'s Capoten and Merck &amp; Co.'s Vasotec, are known as ACE inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin.
Studies are under way to see if these ACE inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure.","An experiment with more than 1700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.
The tests, which measure the activity of a blood protein called renin, may also suggest a new risk factor for heart attacks.
The study was conducted on people found to have mild to moderately high blood pressure.
Only 12% of these people had high renin ""profiles"".
But 7 heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidents of heart attacks.
The study has implications for drug makers as well as patients.","[[36, 56], [4850, 4870], [4889, 4995], [2321, 2338], [2356, 2377], [2417, 2449], [2467, 2486], [32, 35], [52, 172], [2321, 2338], [2356, 2377], [2417, 2421], [2428, 2486], [3079, 3130], [3131, 3229], [5106, 5173]]"

On the other hand, in other patients with high blood pressure, the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood.
These ""low renin"" people are at a low risk of heart attack, Dr. Laragh has maintained.
In the experiment, blood and urine samples were obtained at New York City offices and factories from 1,717 workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure.
The patients' high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by Michael H. Alderman and his colleagues at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who operate a work-site blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions.
In 1981, Dr. Laragh's group began testing the renin activity in blood and urine samples collected by Dr. Alderman's team.
They kept track of the workers for more than eight years to see which had heart attacks.
The results, published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, lend strong support to Dr. Laragh's theory.
Only 12% of the patients had high renin ""profiles.""
But the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients, 13 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years of observation.
The incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile -- 5.3 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years -- and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile, 3.3 per 1,000 person-years, Drs.
Alderman, Laragh and their respective colleagues reported.
Regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups, those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks.
Smokers had more heart attacks than nonsmokers, but the incidence of attacks in smokers with high renin profiles was more than six times that in smokers with low renin profiles.
""But the real dynamite is in the patients who didn't have any of the usual risk factors,"" Dr. Laragh said in an interview.
Among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes, ""those with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction {heart attack} than those with normal or low renin profiles,"" the researchers wrote.
There were no heart attacks among the 240 patients with low renin profiles who had no risk factors other than high blood pressure.
To Dr. Laragh, this suggests that a high renin profile might signal a high risk of heart attack even for people without high blood pressure.
""We think everybody should have this simple and accurate test,"" he said in the interview.
""It's a new window into heart disease.""
In an accompanying editorial, Victor J. Dzau of Stanford University medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is ""potentially useful"" in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack.
But, he wrote, ""a larger, population-based study will be important in confirming the results of this paper.""
The experiment has implications for drug makers as well as patients.
Apparently by coincidence, Abbott Laboratories announced on Tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin.
Other major drug makers are thought to also be working on renin inhibitors.
The experiment hints these drugs might also protect patients from heart attacks.
A big-selling class of high blood pressure drugs, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp.'s Capoten and Merck &amp; Co.'s Vasotec, are known as ACE inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin.
Studies are under way to see if these ACE inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure.","An experiment indicates that a blood and urine test of individuals with high blood pressure can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.
The test also can determine those patients whose risk of heart attack is extremely low.
The test determines whether the kidneys are releasing too much renin into the blood.
People with high levels of rennin are at a high risk of heart attack.
The test can be especially useful for determining heart attack risks in patients without any of the usual risk factors.
Those in this group with high rennin levels were seven times more likely to suffer a heart attack.","[[52, 56], [58, 72], [112, 117], [119, 134], [140, 151], [153, 170], [493, 496], [2234, 2292], [1037, 1111], [2020, 2075], [3983, 4065], [4183, 4252], [4276, 4288], [0, 56]]"

"To date, the administration's prescription for the nation's health-care problems has been: Take two aspirin and call us in a couple of years.
Despite skyrocketing health costs and more than 30 million uninsured people, the White House has virtually steered clear of the subject.
In recent weeks, though, at least some of the president's advisers have begun to call for a change.
While Mr. Sununu continues to argue against addressing the issue, Budget Director Richard Darman has said publicly he believes the White House should propose a sweeping health-care reform by next year.
And others, like presidential pollster Robert Teeter, are reluctantly concluding that the issue may be too hot to be ignored.
""Clearly there is a real need to get behind this,"" says GOP political consultant Rich Bond.
""Just as the Democrats can be seen to be floundering around on foreign-policy issues, the Republicans have not yet put their best minds to work on the health-care issue.""
Former Bush campaign adviser Deborah Steelman, one of the few Republican strategists who has been following the issue, says many of her party have come to believe that ""health care is to the '90s what taxes were to the '80s.""
She adds, ""If we give away this issue, we are giving away the game of the decade.""
Political pressure for health-care reform is clearly on the rise.
Business and interest groups are up in arms, members of Congress are restless, and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has been sounding alarms about rising needs and costs.
So far, however, President Bush has said little.
The administration has made some modest proposals on infant health care, immunizing preschool children and capping medical-liability costs.
But the president has put little effort into promoting them -- in one case abandoning a long-planned trip to Chicago and sending Vice President Quayle as a substitute.
In part, the White House reticence dates back to the 1988 campaign.
Health care for the uninsured was a signature issue for Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis, who started a plan to provide benefits to the uninsured in his native Massachusetts.
Bush advisers, however, paid only cursory attention to the issue, preferring to focus on education and the environment, issues where they felt they had a stronger hand.
Many political strategists continue to defend a low-key approach through the 1992 campaign.
At a health-policy group last month, GOP pollster Bill McInturff reiterated the view that ""people most concerned with the {issue} were not big parts of the Republican coalition.""
Mr. McInturff's review of ABC News exit-polling data for the group showed those who identified health care as their primary concern mainly fell into four subgroups: the uninsured, the poor, Hispanics and blacks.
These groups voted for Mr. Dukakis in margins ranging from from 56% to 88%, he said.
Republican National Committee Chairman Clayton Yeutter, who has been at White House strategy meetings where health care has been discussed, also plays down the issue.
It's ""an issue that will have to be confronted by the nation sometime in the next few years,"" he says, but for now ""there clearly is not a consensus in the Republican Party . . .
about what the answers should be.""
His advice: ""I wouldn't put it in the top five"" problems facing the country.
Mr. Yeutter's comments echo those made by Mr. Sununu in April at a meeting with Republican Reps. Bill Archer of Texas and John Kasich of Ohio, who had been tossing around ideas on the issue.
At present, health is a losing game for the GOP, Mr. Sununu said, because the Democrats will always ""up the ante"" -- promising more benefits and more coverage with little regard for the costs.
Republicans inevitably will be cast as a bunch of Scrooges, he argued, unwilling to help the nation's helpless Tiny Tims.
Spearheading the other side, however, is Mr. Darman.
In a meeting with reporters earlier this month, he argued that the White House should come up with a comprehensive health-care-reform plan before the 1992 election.
The issue could then be debated during the campaign, he said, clearing the way for a giant legislative package shortly after the election.
Asked whether Mr. Sununu agreed with his view, Mr. Darman paused, then replied: ""I don't know.""
Mr. Teeter, a close political adviser to the president, also seems to be slowly acknowledging a need to address the issue, although he continues to express skepticism about plans for a big fix.
""My view is that . . .
when you've got a problem this big . . .
that has huge financial implications, it never gets solved in a democracy in one fell swoop,"" he says.
""You bite off pieces of the problem and let the system digest the changes.""
Some Republican officials have found an even more persuasive argument for addressing health-care problems closer to home -- in the illness and death of former party chairman Lee Atwater.
Mr. Atwater was stricken in March 1990 with what turned out to be an inoperable brain tumor, but he remained on the Republican National Committee payroll and health plan.
The insurance carrier threatened to triple the committee's rates unless it dropped Mr. Atwater's coverage.
Instead, the committee changed insurance companies.
But rates are now so high, says Mr. Yeutter, ""that many of our not-very-well-paid young people can't afford the coverage.""
(See related story: ""Congressional Republicans Find They Are Facing `Revolt of the Haves'"" -- WSJ June 24, 1991)","Although Democrats see health-care reform as a major campaign issue, Republicans differ on its importance and seem reluctant to act.
Some Republicans believe that ""health care is to the '90s what taxes were to the '80s.""
Other Republicans cite an ABC News poll which indicates that those who identify heath care as their primary concern mainly fall into typically Democratic Party constituencies.
Therefore, Mr. Sununu believes heath-care is a losing game for the GOP.
He states that the Democrats will always, ""up the ante"" -- promising more benefits and coverage with little regard to cost.
Republicans inevitably will be cast as a bunch of Scrooges.","[[1032, 1042], [1106, 1195], [2604, 2630], [2645, 2709], [2710, 2726], [3536, 3583], [3573, 3716], [3717, 3775], [2594, 2603], [2015, 2051], [2790, 2824], [889, 967], [812, 821], [1289, 1320], [4057, 4108]]"
"To date, the administration's prescription for the nation's health-care problems has been: Take two aspirin and call us in a couple of years.
Despite skyrocketing health costs and more than 30 million uninsured people, the White House has virtually steered clear of the subject.
In recent weeks, though, at least some of the president's advisers have begun to call for a change.
While Mr. Sununu continues to argue against addressing the issue, Budget Director Richard Darman has said publicly he believes the White House should propose a sweeping health-care reform by next year.
And others, like presidential pollster Robert Teeter, are reluctantly concluding that the issue may be too hot to be ignored.
""Clearly there is a real need to get behind this,"" says GOP political consultant Rich Bond.
""Just as the Democrats can be seen to be floundering around on foreign-policy issues, the Republicans have not yet put their best minds to work on the health-care issue.""
Former Bush campaign adviser Deborah Steelman, one of the few Republican strategists who has been following the issue, says many of her party have come to believe that ""health care is to the '90s what taxes were to the '80s.""
She adds, ""If we give away this issue, we are giving away the game of the decade.""
Political pressure for health-care reform is clearly on the rise.
Business and interest groups are up in arms, members of Congress are restless, and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has been sounding alarms about rising needs and costs.
So far, however, President Bush has said little.
The administration has made some modest proposals on infant health care, immunizing preschool children and capping medical-liability costs.
But the president has put little effort into promoting them -- in one case abandoning a long-planned trip to Chicago and sending Vice President Quayle as a substitute.
In part, the White House reticence dates back to the 1988 campaign.
Health care for the uninsured was a signature issue for Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis, who started a plan to provide benefits to the uninsured in his native Massachusetts.
Bush advisers, however, paid only cursory attention to the issue, preferring to focus on education and the environment, issues where they felt they had a stronger hand.
Many political strategists continue to defend a low-key approach through the 1992 campaign.
At a health-policy group last month, GOP pollster Bill McInturff reiterated the view that ""people most concerned with the {issue} were not big parts of the Republican coalition.""
Mr. McInturff's review of ABC News exit-polling data for the group showed those who identified health care as their primary concern mainly fell into four subgroups: the uninsured, the poor, Hispanics and blacks.
These groups voted for Mr. Dukakis in margins ranging from from 56% to 88%, he said.
Republican National Committee Chairman Clayton Yeutter, who has been at White House strategy meetings where health care has been discussed, also plays down the issue.
It's ""an issue that will have to be confronted by the nation sometime in the next few years,"" he says, but for now ""there clearly is not a consensus in the Republican Party . . .
about what the answers should be.""
His advice: ""I wouldn't put it in the top five"" problems facing the country.
Mr. Yeutter's comments echo those made by Mr. Sununu in April at a meeting with Republican Reps. Bill Archer of Texas and John Kasich of Ohio, who had been tossing around ideas on the issue.
At present, health is a losing game for the GOP, Mr. Sununu said, because the Democrats will always ""up the ante"" -- promising more benefits and more coverage with little regard for the costs.
Republicans inevitably will be cast as a bunch of Scrooges, he argued, unwilling to help the nation's helpless Tiny Tims.

"And President Bush, who initially expected his nominee to be approved with a minimum of fuss, may have to use a lot of political capital in the battle over the nomination, even allies seem to acknowledge.
""We have an obligation to get as much information as possible,"" Alaska Sen. Frank Murkowski, a Gates backer and the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview yesterday.
""It's doubtful we can finish till October,"" when the special prosecutor investigating the Iran-Contra scandal is likely to conclude his inquiry.
Even Oklahoma Democrat David Boren, the committee chairman, who is a big Gates backer and supporter of the CIA, has been privately unnerved by the new situation.
""Another page of Iran-Contra is turning, and with every page you have a chance to solve another piece of the puzzle,"" says New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley, a leading Gates critic on the committee.
The rapid change in prognosis is almost entirely the result of last week's guilty plea by former CIA official Alan Fiers, who conceded that he knew about the central feature of Iran-Contra: the diversion of funds from Iranian arms sales to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Mr. Gates has said he didn't know about the diversion, and Mr. Fiers hasn't directly contradicted him.
But he has said he told Clair George, who headed covert operations at the CIA and was just one step below Mr. Gates, then deputy director of the agency.
Before it votes on Mr. Gates, the panel is trying to arrange to question Messrs. Fiers and George under oath to find out what they know about Mr. Gates's knowledge of Iran-Contra.
But Mr. Fiers is refusing to appear unless he is granted immunity from further prosecution.
Congressional sources say Mr. George, who appears to be under investigation by the prosecutor, is also refusing to talk unless he gets immunity.
Sen. Murkowski said yesterday he doubts either man can be heard from until the prosecutor is finished with them in the fall.
When Mr. Bush chose Mr. Gates for the post, he was betting that the controversy over the Iran-Contra scandal, which forced Mr. Gates to withdraw his 1987 nomination for the same job, had died down.
And the White House hoped that Mr. Gates's performance since 1989 as deputy national security adviser had won enough friends in Congress to bolster confidence in his integrity.
Mr. Gates still has strong supporters on the committee.
""I don't think opinion has shifted on the committee because of the new developments,"" Sen. Boren says.
Among many committee members, Mr. Gates benefits from a widespread sense that he is a good bureaucratic operator who won't be afraid to order significant changes in the way the U.S. intelligence committee does business in the changed world of the 1990s.
While Sen. Bradley and a fellow Democrat, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, have been vociferous critics of Mr. Gates, some other committee Democrats, such as Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini and South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings, might be more willing to side with President Bush and his choice.
And there are few obvious defectors among the 15-member committee's seven Republicans.
There are also some influential outside voices defending Mr. Gates's integrity.
Retired Adm. Bobby Inman, who like Mr. Gates served for a time as deputy CIA chief to William Casey, says Mr. Casey enforced a system where the covert-operations staff reported directly to the director, and around the deputy.
""That's why I accept Bob Gates's direct assurances to me that he wasn't involved,"" he says.
Mr. Gates isn't returning reporters' phone calls, but Sen. Murkowski, who spoke to him yesterday, says the nominee ""is ready to go"" with the hearings, and isn't considering withdrawing his name from consideration.
Ideally, the White House would like the committee to vote before Congress starts its summer recess Aug. 5.
But that isn't in the cards.
Instead, the committee is weighing two options, neither of them pleasant for the White House: either waiting until fall to begin the hearings, or starting them soon to allow Mr. Gates to testify -- then recessing until the fall when it may know more about what the prosecutor is turning up.
The committee is planning to meet today to discuss which of those options it will choose.
""It's pretty much up to the White House,"" says Sen. Murkowski, who says he thinks the White House favors an early start no matter when the hearings would end.
Either way, Mr. Gates would be left hanging for weeks, while rumors swirl of his involvement in various covert operations.
The process could be speeded if the panel votes to grant Messrs. Fiers and George immunity from prosecution.
Committee sources say that's a possibility in the case of Mr. Fiers, who has already pleaded guilty to misleading Congress.
But the committee would probably be reluctant to vote immunity for Mr. George, who hasn't been charged with any crimes.
And Mr. George, a bureaucratic foe of Mr. Gates's, might be a more important witness.
Sens. Boren and Murkowski insist that the panel's role isn't to broadly investigate either Iran-Contra or the CIA, just to focus narrowly on Mr. Gates's personal activities.
But a number of other issues seem likely to slow and complicate the Gates hearings, committee officials say.
One is the recently disclosed existence of a CIA taping system for recording calls between agency officials and their field officers.
The system wasn't illegal, but its scope wasn't fully appreciated in Congress, even during the Iran-Contra probe.
The committee may want to know if Mr. Gates was involved in hiding the existence of such tapes, or if the tapes contain new information on his activities during the Iran-Contra operations.
A second issue concerns reports that the CIA played some role in the unfolding financial scandal involving BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A.
And a third matter involves allegations, including some aired by ABC News and published in the Financial Times, that the CIA tolerated or even assisted Iraqi efforts to smuggle out U.S. weapons technology during the Iran-Iraq War through Chile and South Africa.
ABC asserts, and the White House denies, that Mr. Gates met with a Chilean arms dealer to discuss the effort.
The CIA yesterday denied it ever provided military aid to Iraq.
Like the taping system, the alleged Iraqi weapons-supply operation wouldn't necessarily have been illegal; unlike Iran, Iraq wasn't then banned as a weapons recipient, and U.S. policy at the time favored helping Iraq to win the war.
But Congress might want to know why it wasn't informed of a major effort to arm Iraq.
To further complicate the hearings, Mr. Gates has made enemies at the CIA in his years in the government, and some of them have secretly gone to the intelligence committee with their complaints.
There always has been a cultural divide and antagonism at the agency between analysts -- Mr. Gates's background -- and covert operators.
Operations officers ""don't have anything specific against"" Mr. Gates but are leery because he comes from the other side of the CIA house, says Kenneth deGraffenreid, who oversaw intelligence programs as a National Security Council officer in the Reagan administration.
In particular, Mr. Gates pushed for bureaucratic changes that compelled operations officers to work together with analysts on new task forces looking at such issues as terrorism and drugs.
Supporters say Mr. Gates also has ruffled some bureaucratic feathers over the years among his analyst colleagues by pushing them to make their work less academic and more closely attuned to questions posed by policy makers.
Views of him are ""split along the lines of people who think that he's innovative vs. people who are more comfortable with the traditional ways of doing business,"" says Roy Godson, head of the Consortium for the Study of Intelligence.

Senate Intelligence Committee considerations now, however, threaten to last for months.
The change in prognosis is due to the investigation of the Iran-Contra Affair, as well as concerns about CIA's role in the BCCI Holdings and arms smuggling, and antagonisms between CIA officials.
Namely, the Senate is questioning former CIA officials as to what they know about Mr. Gate's knowledge of Iran-Contra; and inquiring about complaints that he pushed analysts to make their work less academic and more attuned to policymakers questions.","[[4, 18], [24, 93], [662, 665], [2006, 2011], [2016, 2034], [347, 376], [411, 451], [482, 519], [932, 954], [971, 984], [5196, 5262], [5741, 5749], [5763, 5794], [5833, 5846], [5196, 5262], [5986, 5989], [6008, 6016], [6034, 6041], [6051, 6058], [6620, 6654], [6660, 6693], [6815, 6820], [6828, 6836], [6859, 6900], [6930, 6950], [347, 353], [1012, 1031], [1037, 1042], [1327, 1333], [1335, 1374], [1480, 1502], [1514, 1522], [1531, 1536], [1541, 1547], [1571, 1628], [347, 353], [6757, 6813], [7429, 7434], [7504, 7632]]"
"And President Bush, who initially expected his nominee to be approved with a minimum of fuss, may have to use a lot of political capital in the battle over the nomination, even allies seem to acknowledge.
""We have an obligation to get as much information as possible,"" Alaska Sen. Frank Murkowski, a Gates backer and the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview yesterday.
""It's doubtful we can finish till October,"" when the special prosecutor investigating the Iran-Contra scandal is likely to conclude his inquiry.
Even Oklahoma Democrat David Boren, the committee chairman, who is a big Gates backer and supporter of the CIA, has been privately unnerved by the new situation.
""Another page of Iran-Contra is turning, and with every page you have a chance to solve another piece of the puzzle,"" says New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley, a leading Gates critic on the committee.
The rapid change in prognosis is almost entirely the result of last week's guilty plea by former CIA official Alan Fiers, who conceded that he knew about the central feature of Iran-Contra: the diversion of funds from Iranian arms sales to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Mr. Gates has said he didn't know about the diversion, and Mr. Fiers hasn't directly contradicted him.
But he has said he told Clair George, who headed covert operations at the CIA and was just one step below Mr. Gates, then deputy director of the agency.
Before it votes on Mr. Gates, the panel is trying to arrange to question Messrs. Fiers and George under oath to find out what they know about Mr. Gates's knowledge of Iran-Contra.
But Mr. Fiers is refusing to appear unless he is granted immunity from further prosecution.
Congressional sources say Mr. George, who appears to be under investigation by the prosecutor, is also refusing to talk unless he gets immunity.
Sen. Murkowski said yesterday he doubts either man can be heard from until the prosecutor is finished with them in the fall.
When Mr. Bush chose Mr. Gates for the post, he was betting that the controversy over the Iran-Contra scandal, which forced Mr. Gates to withdraw his 1987 nomination for the same job, had died down.
And the White House hoped that Mr. Gates's performance since 1989 as deputy national security adviser had won enough friends in Congress to bolster confidence in his integrity.
Mr. Gates still has strong supporters on the committee.
""I don't think opinion has shifted on the committee because of the new developments,"" Sen. Boren says.
Among many committee members, Mr. Gates benefits from a widespread sense that he is a good bureaucratic operator who won't be afraid to order significant changes in the way the U.S. intelligence committee does business in the changed world of the 1990s.
While Sen. Bradley and a fellow Democrat, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, have been vociferous critics of Mr. Gates, some other committee Democrats, such as Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini and South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings, might be more willing to side with President Bush and his choice.
And there are few obvious defectors among the 15-member committee's seven Republicans.
There are also some influential outside voices defending Mr. Gates's integrity.
Retired Adm. Bobby Inman, who like Mr. Gates served for a time as deputy CIA chief to William Casey, says Mr. Casey enforced a system where the covert-operations staff reported directly to the director, and around the deputy.
""That's why I accept Bob Gates's direct assurances to me that he wasn't involved,"" he says.
Mr. Gates isn't returning reporters' phone calls, but Sen. Murkowski, who spoke to him yesterday, says the nominee ""is ready to go"" with the hearings, and isn't considering withdrawing his name from consideration.
Ideally, the White House would like the committee to vote before Congress starts its summer recess Aug. 5.
But that isn't in the cards.
Instead, the committee is weighing two options, neither of them pleasant for the White House: either waiting until fall to begin the hearings, or starting them soon to allow Mr. Gates to testify -- then recessing until the fall when it may know more about what the prosecutor is turning up.
The committee is planning to meet today to discuss which of those options it will choose.
""It's pretty much up to the White House,"" says Sen. Murkowski, who says he thinks the White House favors an early start no matter when the hearings would end.
Either way, Mr. Gates would be left hanging for weeks, while rumors swirl of his involvement in various covert operations.
The process could be speeded if the panel votes to grant Messrs. Fiers and George immunity from prosecution.
Committee sources say that's a possibility in the case of Mr. Fiers, who has already pleaded guilty to misleading Congress.
But the committee would probably be reluctant to vote immunity for Mr. George, who hasn't been charged with any crimes.
And Mr. George, a bureaucratic foe of Mr. Gates's, might be a more important witness.
Sens. Boren and Murkowski insist that the panel's role isn't to broadly investigate either Iran-Contra or the CIA, just to focus narrowly on Mr. Gates's personal activities.
But a number of other issues seem likely to slow and complicate the Gates hearings, committee officials say.
One is the recently disclosed existence of a CIA taping system for recording calls between agency officials and their field officers.
The system wasn't illegal, but its scope wasn't fully appreciated in Congress, even during the Iran-Contra probe.
The committee may want to know if Mr. Gates was involved in hiding the existence of such tapes, or if the tapes contain new information on his activities during the Iran-Contra operations.
A second issue concerns reports that the CIA played some role in the unfolding financial scandal involving BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A.
And a third matter involves allegations, including some aired by ABC News and published in the Financial Times, that the CIA tolerated or even assisted Iraqi efforts to smuggle out U.S. weapons technology during the Iran-Iraq War through Chile and South Africa.
ABC asserts, and the White House denies, that Mr. Gates met with a Chilean arms dealer to discuss the effort.
The CIA yesterday denied it ever provided military aid to Iraq.
Like the taping system, the alleged Iraqi weapons-supply operation wouldn't necessarily have been illegal; unlike Iran, Iraq wasn't then banned as a weapons recipient, and U.S. policy at the time favored helping Iraq to win the war.
But Congress might want to know why it wasn't informed of a major effort to arm Iraq.
To further complicate the hearings, Mr. Gates has made enemies at the CIA in his years in the government, and some of them have secretly gone to the intelligence committee with their complaints.
There always has been a cultural divide and antagonism at the agency between analysts -- Mr. Gates's background -- and covert operators.

"In addition, a subpoena was authorized for Clair George, the CIA's former deputy director for operations, but no decision is expected to be made on immunity for him until Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has completed whatever case he is making against Mr. George, who was Mr. Fiers's superior.
The decision to postpone the hearings, now scheduled to begin Sept. 16, follows behind-the-scenes discussions between committee leaders and the Bush administration, which last night concurred with the decision.
""A start-and-stop hearing and confirmation process dragging out over a number of weeks would not be fair to Mr. Gates,"" said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
The statement reflects a calculated retreat after demands by President Bush for quick action, and administration officials said the committee spurned a White House request to free Mr. Gates to speak out publicly to defend himself against any future charges that might arise during a break in the hearings.
Traditionally, congressional committees require nominees to maintain a public silence outside the committee room on issues pertaining to their confirmation until the process is complete.
Mr. Gates met privately late Monday with Sen. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat, and Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the panel.
As a practical matter, the White House needs time itself to regroup and prepare its case for the nomination.
Mr. Fiers's recent guilty pleas have provoked renewed interest in the role played by CIA officials -- including Mr. Gates -- in the sales of arms to Iran and the use of profits to supply Nicaraguan guerrillas.
Mr. Gates served then as deputy to William Casey, the late CIA director and a central figure in the scandal.
Mr. Fiers's court statements indicate that people in the agency's operations division had knowledge as well of both the diversion of funds and supply operation.
Mr. George is among those implicated in Mr. Fiers's pleadings, and a central issue is whether Mr. Gates failed as deputy director to oversee what was happening in the agency.
Mr. Gates has repeatedly denied knowledge of the diversion, but evidence collected by House and Senate IranContra Committees in 1987 indicates that he received early warnings from those under him in the summer and fall of 1986.
As significant, there is interest in a White House staff memo describing the agenda for a May 1986 meeting between the then-national security adviser, Adm. John Poindexter, and Messrs. Casey and Gates regarding a proposal for the CIA to lease a ship controlled by the secret arms-supply network.
The vessel, a small coastal freighter, had been purchased for $312,000 in April with funds generated partly by the sale of arms to Iran.
Adm. Poindexter's aide, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, was seeking to lease it to the CIA for $1.2 million for six months.
The memo makes clear that the freighter -- dubbed ""Ollie's ship"" -- was already known to CIA officials and Mr. Casey was coming to the meeting with Mr. Gates with a briefing paper prepared by the CIA on the proposed lease.
Though there is no evidence Mr. Gates knew then of how the ship was financed, the prospect of such a large asset's being put forward by Col. North's network indicated the size of the operation being run from the White House.
Among those opposing the proposed lease arrangement -- which was ultimately squelched -- was Mr. George, who served under Mr. Gates but often reported directly to Mr. Casey.
The former operations director deeply distrusted some of the private operatives used in Col. North's network, and his own testimony to Iran-Contra investigators is revealing of the tension facing CIA officials at the time.
At one level, officers sought to shield themselves from knowledge of the operation, but at the same time there was professional concern that the administration was relying on people who had been associated with the renegade former CIA agent, Edwin Wilson.
Apart from Mr. George, the committee also authorized a subpoena for the testimony of a senior CIA official identified by Mr. Boren as Jerry Gruner.
Mr. Gruner, currently serving overseas, is one of two CIA officials, as well as Mr. George, cited in a government statement describing those who Mr. Fiers said knew about the diversion before it became public.
The statement, issued in connection with Mr. Fiers's guilty plea, doesn't specifically name Mr. Gruner and describes him only as Mr. Fiers's superior and chief of the CIA's Latin American division.
The statement says Mr. Fiers told the CIA superior about the diversion in the summer of 1986 and the official instructed him to report the information to Mr. George.
William Hundley, a Washington lawyer who represents Mr. Gruner, disputed the government's account and said his client didn't learn of the diversion from Mr. Fiers until ""the whole matter started to unravel"" in the fall of 1986.

These include Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
Currently, the only announced candidate is former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas; Iowa's liberal Democratic senator, Tom Harkin, is likely to declare next month.
Neither of these candidates, however, is considered very formidable, and either would be a prohibitive underdog in a general election against George Bush.
Thus, the Gore announcement is likely to focus anew the spotlight on New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
The New York governor, who delights in causing press speculation about his intentions, says he has no plans to run but won't rule out changing his mind.
As a candidate, Gov. Cuomo would have clear weaknesses -- in particular, his identification as a New York liberal, which wouldn't play well in much of the South, and his state's financial woes, which would make it tougher to capitalize on the economic issue nationally.
But his commanding presence and intellect privately worry some top Bush strategists, and generally he's rated the Democrats' strongest candidate by political experts from both parties.
""Cuomo is the only semi-heavyweight left in the Democratic field,"" said Douglas Bailey, a Republican strategist.

"Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) has said that the Senate is ""entitled to a direct, categorical answer"" on Judge Thomas's stance on abortion, and on Roe v. Wade.
Thurgood Marshall's example makes it plain, though, that Mr. Thomas may refuse to give that categorical answer.
During the Marshall hearings in 1967, the issue of the day was not abortion but crime, and the most controversial case was Miranda v. Arizona.
Sen. John L. McClellan (D., Ark.) pressed Mr. Marshall to reveal his opinion of the case.
Mr. Marshall refused, explaining that there were other cases pending on variations and interpretations of Miranda and that, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, he would have to rule on those cases: ""On decisions that are certain to be re-examined in the court, it would be improper for me to comment on them in advance. . . .
From all the hearings I have read about, it has been considered and recognized as improper for a nominee to a judgeship to comment on a case he will have to pass on.""
Sen. McClellan emphasized that he did not want comments on a future case, but on a past case, Miranda.
But Mr. Marshall held firm, stating that future cases would be related to interpretations of Miranda, and that the issue of crime was still very controversial.
Sen. Sam Ervin (D., N.C.) attempted to get Mr. Marshall to discuss the case law that preceded Miranda, in much the same way that Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.) attempted to persuade Judge Souter to comment on the right of privacy at issue in the abortion cases, by way of Griswold v. Connecticut.
But Mr. Marshall would not even remark on the 14 words in the Fifth Amendment concerning self-incrimination.
Sen. Ervin, exasperated, pointed out that since the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is so broad that a case on practically any issue might come before it, Mr. Marshall's theory meant that the committee would have a difficult time asking any questions about Mr. Marshall's judicial philosophy.
""It is a problem,"" Mr. Marshall said, though a problem for the committee, not the nominee.
In the end, Mr. Marshall would comment only on such long-decided cases as the Gibbons v. Ogden case of 1824, which concerned issues of such vintage that they were no longer controversial.
Some of Mr. Thomas's detractors have openly worried that he seems too distant from his origins in the segregated South.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, delegate to Congress from the District of Columbia, said that she hoped he would ""bring to the bench his personal experience as a poor black man.""
Harvard Law School's Derrick Bell fears that Mr. Thomas would ""look black but think white.""
But such personal experiences are irrelevant to the work of a justice of the Supreme Court, according to Thurgood Marshall.
""A judge is not permitted to use his own personal views under any circumstances,"" he said, ""but if the particular decision-maker, whether he be judge or justice or magistrate, applies the Constitution to the facts and it comes out that way, that is inevitable.""
Sometimes the outcome of a case is incidentally related to a justice's private views, but personal preferences can play no part in the decision-making process.
Such crusading zeal is inappropriate, despite the 1990 call of Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) for a nominee with ""fire in the belly.""
""There is nothing personal allowed, nothing personal,"" Mr. Marshall emphasized.
Justices ""shall not use their personal views, and indeed, they take an oath not to do so.""
The intellectual leaders of the coalition that defeated the Bork nomination, notably Laurence Tribe in his 1987 book, ""God Bless This Honorable Court,"" insisted that the Senate had the right -- and the responsibility -- to scrutinize a nominee's general political or judicial philosophy.
This issue was raised in the Marshall hearings too.
Clearly a senator may vote any way he wishes on a nomination, and for any reason; but not all votes nor all reasons are consistent with the duties of senators, and with the manner in which they ought to behave.
This thought was expressed most eloquently by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), whose primary contribution to the Marshall hearings was elucidating the normative guidelines for senators.
Sen. Kennedy stressed a central point both in the committee room and before the full Senate: The Senate is to assess qualifications; it is not to examine political or judicial philosophy.
""We are not charged with the responsibility of approving a man to be associate justice of the Supreme Court only if his views always coincide with our own,"" Sen. Kennedy stated.
""We are not seeking a nominee for the Supreme Court who will express the majority view of the Senate on every given issue, or on a given issue of fundamental importance.""
It was Sen. Kennedy's view that only the professional background of a nominee was relevant for senatorial consideration, not his substantive views.
The question of ""ideological balance"" on the court was also raised in this context, and addressed by Sen. Roman Hruska (D., Neb.).
Sen. Hruska had received letters stating that Mr. Marshall was too liberal for the Supreme Court, that he would upset the ""balance"" between liberals and conservatives.
Sen. Hruska dismissed these fears as irrelevant.
""The nominating power lies with the president of the United States; and if it is his desire to appoint someone he considers a liberal, that is his prerogative.
If he wants to nominate someone he considers a conservative, that is also his prerogative.""
The role of the Senate is to ""inquire into the integrity, the competence and the record of a man,"" not his ideology.
Several other issues were brought up during the Marshall hearings that have a bearing on Judge Thomas's case.
Sen. Kennedy believed that because Mr. Marshall had been moved through the Judiciary Committee before, the Senate could ""move expeditiously ahead with his confirmation.""
Mr. Thomas, too, has been previously approved by the committee.
Mr. Marshall had been accused of having communist ties, in part because in one case he cited a work by Herbert Aptheker, a leading U.S. communist theoretician.
Committee Chairman James Eastland (D., Miss.) raised this issue, but only to allow Mr. Marshall to clarify the facts, and to state that he was not a communist.
Mr. Thomas's supposed ties to Louis Farrakhan seem entitled to equal treatment.
Finally, the fact that Mr. Marshall was black was treated as noteworthy, but not determinative.
In the case of Judge Thomas, blackness ought to be regarded the same way.
The fact that Mr. Thomas's judicial views are not the same as those of Thurgood Marshall is a reflection of the increasingly pluralistic nature of black society, but hardly an issue worthy of senatorial consideration.
As the second black American to serve on the Supreme Court, Judge Thomas will shoulder many responsibilities; not because he is black, but because he will hold a lofty office.
--- Mr. Robbins is a historian in Ayer, Mass.","Opponents of the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court maintain that the nominee should be required to answer specific questions about his personal and philosophical beliefs.
Yet the justice whom the nominee would replace took a firm stand against answering just such questions at his hearings in 1967.
Thurgood Marshall said ""A judge is not permitted to use his own personal views under any circumstances.""
At those hearings Senator Edward Kennedy stressed a central point both in the committee room and before the full Senate: The Senate is to assess qualifications; it is not to examine political or judicial philosophy.","[[48, 161], [2744, 2833], [4064, 4083], [4124, 4148], [4204, 4390], [275, 311], [452, 528], [1107, 1129]]"
"Excepting the differences one would expect among independent thinkers, Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork are cut from the same judicial cloth.
And so he too was a symbol that had to be destroyed.
The attack on Clarence Thomas, which boggled tens of millions of viewing Americans, makes sense only if one understands that the roots of the struggle extend back to 1980 and Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency.
One of the most persistent arguments of those who opposed the Reagan era was that it was a fluke, that he was simply not elected President because people agreed with his conservative political philosophy.
Believing this to be true, opponents of the Reagan presidency then argued that his nomination of the like-minded Judge Bork was also illegitimate.
As they put it, ""out of the mainstream.""
We have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted Ronald Reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections.
With the televised Thomas hearings we have in effect just held another national election.
And the public, by every measure available, gave Judge Thomas what in a normal election would be called their landslide support.
This doesn't mean that the American people support Judge Thomas -- or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan -- in every detail of their political beliefs.
It is likely even that on the abortion issue, most voters are essentially pro-choice.
We don't doubt, however, that in terms of the presidency or the Supreme Court, voters are willing to risk disappointment on discrete issues if they approve the fundamental direction.
They have now given their consent in three successive presidential elections to a direction that can fairly be called conservative.
The Supreme Court nominations of George Bush comport with those results.
The difference, however, between the American people and the permanent political establishment in Washington is that Washington no longer feels constrained by the American political system.
It won't wait for the next election, nor -- more importantly -- will it make the effort to persuade the electorate to support its views of Supreme Court nominations.
They'd rather fight their battles inside the Beltway, which lets them operate free of input from this nation's huge electorate.
They can't possibly have wanted the sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the entire American population.
It did, and they were undone by a system that they made.
That system has depended crucially on the support of an ideologically compliant Washington press corps, which would normally render a target politically controversial and, in a risk-averse town, untouchable.
Cut off from their support base, Judge Bork, Ed Meese, Oliver North and others have been left bleeding on the Washington fields.
With Judge Thomas, however, the system ran out of control.
Washington's reporters, who had already largely broken away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism, even broke away from the congressional staffs and special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story into a bonfire of personal and political grievances.
They seemed to be demanding a national referendum on sexual harassment, meaning a Senate vote for the accuser, and instead the whole nation showed up and a big majority voted the other way -- to support Clarence Thomas.
Perhaps the voters felt they couldn't trust Washington or Congress with something important.
Now, with Clarence Thomas heading for the Court and the voters going back to their daily lives, what has been learned?
The Democratic Party has to decide whether its future lies with the world view of the special-interest groups and anonymous congressional staff, or with people such as Bill Clinton, Doug Wilder, Paul Tsongas and others, mostly beyond-the-Beltway governors, trying to conform the party's historic ideals to the temper of the modern electorate.
The congressional and White House Republicans should have learned that in a period of divided government, they can only win, as here, by abandoning their traditional passivity in favor of going on the offensive, and without apology.
Black Americans have perhaps the greatest sorting out to do.
The bonfire illuminated the existence of an impressive, moderate black middleclass.
If there is a group of true political independents in this country, they are it.
It looks as if they have a lot to say to Democrats, Republicans and white feminists.
They should stick around and keep talking.
As for Clarence Thomas, we don't agree that he joins the Court in a damaged state.
This country is in the middle of a historic political turning.
There was no reason to expect that the overturning of the old order would be quiet or easy.
But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the American people came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to the Supreme Court.
It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a popular mandate.","The real battle over the confirmation of Clarence Thomas was joined four years ago with the nomination of Robert Bork, but the roots of the struggle go back even farther to the election of Ronald Reagan as president in 1980.
The voters gave Reagan a mandate but the losers overturned the results of the election by engineering Bork's rejection.
This time Washington's reporters tried to arrange a national referendum on sexual harassment thinking this would defeat Thomas.
But by every measure available the public gave Thomas landslide support and Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the Supreme Court with a popular mandate.","[[91, 102], [198, 223], [319, 411], [645, 654], [701, 714], [737, 745], [685, 691], [737, 745], [751, 763], [888, 898], [910, 919], [927, 948], [994, 1009], [1014, 1047], [1054, 1063], [2872, 2910], [2923, 2929], [2971, 2993], [3269, 3321], [3366, 3425], [3443, 3453], [3463, 3469], [5083, 5124], [5130, 5166]]"
"State statutes that bar first-time candidates from running for Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and have been invalidated.
For example, the 1972 decision in Dillon v. Fiorina struck down a New Mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional primary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay a registration fee.
But state statutes that simply limit the tenure of existing congressional officeholders have not yet been tested in court.
The constitutionality of such state term limits may, however, be tested next month.
Florida's attorney general has asked its state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on a term-limit initiative that would limit the state's members of Congress to eight consecutive years in office.
Three U.S. House members, led by Democrat Larry Smith, have filed briefs asking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional.
The court will hear arguments Friday, and may rule later this month.
By 6 to 1, the California Supreme Court ruled this month that the state's new term-limit law was constitutional.
The court said the ""state's strong interests in protecting against an entrenched, dynastic legislative bureaucracy"" outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice at the ballot box.
But the court's decision affected only term limits on state officials; federal officeholders weren't included in California's limits.
Nevertheless, the California decision demolished many of the legal arguments made by incumbents.
They claimed there is a ""fundamental right to be a candidate for public office,"" which they found among the ""associational rights"" in the First Amendment.
They argued that voters were denied the right to be represented by the same legislator indefinitely, and that term limits discriminated against incumbents and denied them their right to equal protection of the laws.
California's highest court rejected all of these arguments.
Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party.
Therefore, they do not deprive voters of the freedom to associate with candidates based on their viewpoint or with any particular party.
Rather, they prevent citizens from voting for a particular candidate after he has served in office a set number of years.
They may vote for that candidate again after a ""waiting period"" has ended.
The restriction is imposed in a non-discriminatory manner on all candidates regardless of viewpoint or party affiliation.
In its 1972 decision Bullock v. Carter and again in its 1982 decision Clements v. Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that a particular candidate has no ""fundamental"" right to ballot access or to run for office.
Federal courts have upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify for ballot access.
They have never held reasonable, non-discriminatory restrictions on who may run a violation of the right to vote.
Likewise, term limits do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court has found that clause violated only in those cases where ballot access restrictions discriminate against the poor and against new, small or independent party candidates.
Unlike the age, residency and citizenship requirements, term limits do not prevent any non-incumbent from running for Congress.
Nor do they prevent a House member who has reached a term limit from running for the U.S. Senate or vice versa.
Nor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a period of time (six years in Washington state) from running again.
Moreover, term limits do not in any way modify the age, residency or citizenship requirements in the Constitution.
Consequently, the argument that term limits are ""qualifications"" just like those already in the Constitution -- and that therefore they can be added only by amending the Constitution -- isn't particularly convincing.
Viewed in this way, term limits imposed by states would be constitutional.
The Supreme Court has long held that the power to ensure a fair electoral system, truly responsive representation in Congress and a high degree of citizen participation in elections rests with the states.
In its 1974 decision Storer v. Brown, the Supreme Court upheld a California law that prohibited an independent candidate from running for Congress because he had changed his registration to Independent less than 11 months before the election.
This law was found not to be an improper additional qualification because a valid state interest was pursued.
In explaining that interest, the court recognized that ""there must be a substantial regulation of elections {by the states} if they are to be fair and honest,"" and if some sort of order is to accompany the democratic process.
As recently as June of this year, the Supreme Court again reiterated that the states have reserved to themselves, via the Tenth Amendment, ""the power to regulate elections.""
Elsewhere, the court in 1988 ruled in South Carolina v. Baker, that certain ""extraordinary defects in the national political process might render congressional regulation of state activities invalid under the Tenth Amendment.""
The court has not defined what it means by ""extraordinary defects,"" but surely the fact that 98% of House incumbents are routinely re-elected and that one out of five incumbents ran with no major-party opposition in 1990 might qualify.
Where the incumbent is almost the pre-ordained winner in an election, there is no effective competition of ideas or candidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will of the electorate.
On this basis, term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the ""republican form of government"" guaranteed the states under the Constitution.
Should the court rule against term limits by the states, numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be passed that have many of the same effects as term limits.
One option would limit an incumbents' access to the ballot.
States could allow an incumbent who has served a set number of years in the same office to run again, but only as a ""write-in"" candidate.
Presumably, if an incumbent were truly effective and popular he wouldn't find that a crushing obstacle.
Two sitting U.S. House Members won their first terms as write-in candidates.
Incumbents would certainly have the resources to educate voters in write-in procedures.
Another option would require candidates to have ""ballot statements"" appear next to their names.
Each candidate would have to answer the question: ""Will you adhere to a -- year term limit?""
The answer would appear on the ballot so voters would know a candidate's views on term limits.
Many such ballot restrictions have been upheld by the courts.
Incumbents should take heed.
If they count only on the courts to safeguard their political castles, they may be in for a rude surprise.

Those against limits say that neither Congress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.
Those arguing for them say that limits are not a qualification.
They do not prevent anyone from having the opportunity to serve in Congress, nor do they prevent voters from voting their ideology or party.
The California Supreme Court has ruled that term limits for state officeholders is constitutional.
The U.S. Supreme Court has reiterated that states, via the Tenth Amendment, have ""the power to regulate elections.""","[[505, 529], [535, 556], [567, 576], [620, 689], [3715, 3764], [3887, 3916], [1962, 2068], [3280, 3350], [1002, 1036], [1048, 1064], [1069, 1102], [4811, 4828], [4835, 4850], [4855, 4866], [4891, 4948]]"
"State statutes that bar first-time candidates from running for Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and have been invalidated.
For example, the 1972 decision in Dillon v. Fiorina struck down a New Mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional primary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay a registration fee.
But state statutes that simply limit the tenure of existing congressional officeholders have not yet been tested in court.
The constitutionality of such state term limits may, however, be tested next month.
Florida's attorney general has asked its state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on a term-limit initiative that would limit the state's members of Congress to eight consecutive years in office.
Three U.S. House members, led by Democrat Larry Smith, have filed briefs asking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional.
The court will hear arguments Friday, and may rule later this month.
By 6 to 1, the California Supreme Court ruled this month that the state's new term-limit law was constitutional.
The court said the ""state's strong interests in protecting against an entrenched, dynastic legislative bureaucracy"" outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice at the ballot box.
But the court's decision affected only term limits on state officials; federal officeholders weren't included in California's limits.
Nevertheless, the California decision demolished many of the legal arguments made by incumbents.
They claimed there is a ""fundamental right to be a candidate for public office,"" which they found among the ""associational rights"" in the First Amendment.
They argued that voters were denied the right to be represented by the same legislator indefinitely, and that term limits discriminated against incumbents and denied them their right to equal protection of the laws.
California's highest court rejected all of these arguments.
Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party.
Therefore, they do not deprive voters of the freedom to associate with candidates based on their viewpoint or with any particular party.
Rather, they prevent citizens from voting for a particular candidate after he has served in office a set number of years.
They may vote for that candidate again after a ""waiting period"" has ended.
The restriction is imposed in a non-discriminatory manner on all candidates regardless of viewpoint or party affiliation.
In its 1972 decision Bullock v. Carter and again in its 1982 decision Clements v. Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that a particular candidate has no ""fundamental"" right to ballot access or to run for office.
Federal courts have upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify for ballot access.
They have never held reasonable, non-discriminatory restrictions on who may run a violation of the right to vote.
Likewise, term limits do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court has found that clause violated only in those cases where ballot access restrictions discriminate against the poor and against new, small or independent party candidates.
Unlike the age, residency and citizenship requirements, term limits do not prevent any non-incumbent from running for Congress.
Nor do they prevent a House member who has reached a term limit from running for the U.S. Senate or vice versa.
Nor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a period of time (six years in Washington state) from running again.
Moreover, term limits do not in any way modify the age, residency or citizenship requirements in the Constitution.
Consequently, the argument that term limits are ""qualifications"" just like those already in the Constitution -- and that therefore they can be added only by amending the Constitution -- isn't particularly convincing.
Viewed in this way, term limits imposed by states would be constitutional.
The Supreme Court has long held that the power to ensure a fair electoral system, truly responsive representation in Congress and a high degree of citizen participation in elections rests with the states.
In its 1974 decision Storer v. Brown, the Supreme Court upheld a California law that prohibited an independent candidate from running for Congress because he had changed his registration to Independent less than 11 months before the election.
This law was found not to be an improper additional qualification because a valid state interest was pursued.
In explaining that interest, the court recognized that ""there must be a substantial regulation of elections {by the states} if they are to be fair and honest,"" and if some sort of order is to accompany the democratic process.
As recently as June of this year, the Supreme Court again reiterated that the states have reserved to themselves, via the Tenth Amendment, ""the power to regulate elections.""
Elsewhere, the court in 1988 ruled in South Carolina v. Baker, that certain ""extraordinary defects in the national political process might render congressional regulation of state activities invalid under the Tenth Amendment.""
The court has not defined what it means by ""extraordinary defects,"" but surely the fact that 98% of House incumbents are routinely re-elected and that one out of five incumbents ran with no major-party opposition in 1990 might qualify.
Where the incumbent is almost the pre-ordained winner in an election, there is no effective competition of ideas or candidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will of the electorate.
On this basis, term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the ""republican form of government"" guaranteed the states under the Constitution.
Should the court rule against term limits by the states, numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be passed that have many of the same effects as term limits.
One option would limit an incumbents' access to the ballot.
States could allow an incumbent who has served a set number of years in the same office to run again, but only as a ""write-in"" candidate.
Presumably, if an incumbent were truly effective and popular he wouldn't find that a crushing obstacle.
Two sitting U.S. House Members won their first terms as write-in candidates.
Incumbents would certainly have the resources to educate voters in write-in procedures.
Another option would require candidates to have ""ballot statements"" appear next to their names.
Each candidate would have to answer the question: ""Will you adhere to a -- year term limit?""
The answer would appear on the ballot so voters would know a candidate's views on term limits.
Many such ballot restrictions have been upheld by the courts.
Incumbents should take heed.
If they count only on the courts to safeguard their political castles, they may be in for a rude surprise.

"Just last week, he was feted at the Spy Club, a chic Washington watering hole.
Among those who helped round up contributors for the $250-a-head fund-raising event were Terence McAuliffe, Gerald Cassidy and Patrick Griffin, three veteran Democrats who also head prominent Washington lobbying firms.
Mr. McAuliffe says the crowd at the Spy Club soiree, which brought in more than $150,000, was young and wasn't dominated by ""the Democratic old-guard.""
But lobbyists were in heavy attendance at two $1,000-a-person Washington fund-raisers the Harkin campaign staged earlier in the political season.
Lorraine Voles, Mr. Harkin's campaign spokeswoman, emphasizes that the bulk of the $1 million that he has raised has come from small, direct-mail donations or from grassroots fund-raising events, not from Washington operatives or political action committees.
But the campaign certainly hasn't spurned financial support from the Washington establishment.
""If you want to be competitive, you have to raise the money,"" Ms. Voles says.
Despite his reputation as a Senate maverick, Mr. Harkin appears to be the 1990 candidate favored by Washington's lobbying community, the spawning ground for many of the Democratic Party's mightiest fund-raisers.
Mr. Harkin's wife, Ruth, is a lawyer-lobbyist at one of the city's most prominent Democratic law firms, Akin, Gump, Hauer &amp; Feld.
Moreover, Sen. Harkin's important positions on the Senate Appropriations and Agriculture Committees are lobbying-intensive.
The Washington firms headed by Mr. Cassidy and Mr. McAuliffe both lobby the appropriations committees extensively.
Mr. McAuliffe says his support for Mr. Harkin has nothing to do with his business activities -- Mr. McAuliffe himself doesn't lobby -- and grows out of friendship.
A spokesman for Mr. Cassidy says he, too, is supporting Mr. Harkin because he is an old friend.
Both men were big supporters of Mr. Harkin's Senate bids.
Sen. Harkin is by no means the only Democrat reaching inside the Beltway for campaign help.
Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor who has emphasized his southern, outside-of-Washington base, has an array of notables serving on his campaign's executive committee.
The group includes Anne Wexler, a former Carter White House aide who heads the Wexler Group, a lobbying powerhouse.
Robert Farmer, a former Democratic Party treasurer who was chief fund-raiser for Michael Dukakis and was, until recently, a member of the Cassidy firm, is raising funds for Mr. Clinton, as is Charles Dolan, another Cassidy lobbyist.
Democratic lawyer David Ifshin, who also advises the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), is the campaign's general counsel.
The Clinton campaign raised $100,000 last month at a cocktail party at the home of Vic Raiser, a politically connected Washington lawyer and also a former Democratic Party treasurer.
Even with anti-Washington voter sentiment running strong, Ms. Wexler says the demand for seasoned campaign strategists and fund-raisers is still strong among Democratic presidential candidates.
""There is something to be said for an institutional memory and experience,"" Ms. Wexler says.
""It isn't a question of insiders or outsiders.""
Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska has fewer ties to Washington insiders.
However, he has appointed John Quinn, a Washington lawyer-lobbyist and veteran of other Democratic presidential efforts, as his campaign's general counsel.
Mr. Quinn, in turn, has brought other Washington lawyers onto the Kerrey team.
The Kerrey campaign will have its own Spy Club fund-raiser, for a more modest $50 a ticket, early next month.
Mr. Quinn, for one, says he is comforted by the absence of other Washington insiders on the Kerrey bench.
""The inside-the-Beltway political community has the best record of being wrong,"" he observes.
In 1988, many Democratic lobbyists flocked to the unsuccessful campaign of Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, a powerful member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the future House majority leader.
Mr. McAuliffe, in fact, was Mr. Gephardt's chief fund-raiser.
Despite his relative paucity of connections with the Washington establishment, Sen. Kerrey does have an in with another important community: Hollywood, where he is best known for his relationship with actress Debra Winger.
Last week, Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc., a unit of News Corp., Sydney, Australia, hosted a Kerrey fund-raising event at his Beverly Hills home.
Among the co-hosts of the $250,000-plus event were Hollywood notables Ted Field, David Geffen and Sherry Lansing.
Former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas, who himself did some Washington lobbying for his law firm, based in Boston, has a number of Washington lawyer-lobbyists helping him with fund-raising.
Douglas Wilder, the Virginia governor, is relying on Robert Blair, another wellknown Washington lawyer-lobbyist, to help raise money.
Even former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who has made running against special interests and the Washington establishment the centerpiece of his campaign, has a few Washington politicos working on his campaign.
But Mr. Brown isn't accepting contributions of more than $100.
Some of the Democratic Party's most experienced campaign veterans are still standing on the sidelines.
Richard Moe, a former top adviser to Walter Mondale and an attorney in the Washington office of Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell, says he's taking a ""self-imposed sabbatical"" from politics these days.
Michael Berman, another Washington lawyer-lobbyist who was a top aide to Mr. Mondale, says he has offered advice to several candidates at their request, but will wait until the Democratic convention to become immersed in the presidential campaign.
Thomas Donilon, another Washington attorney and campaign veteran, is also eschewing presidential politics for the moment.
The Washington insiders who have already affiliated with campaigns have their work cut out for them.
According to the most recent Federal Election Commission filings, the Democratic presidential candidates, as of Sept. 30, had together raised only $2.3 million.
At the same point four years ago, five Democrats had each raised more than $2 million, with Michael Dukakis topping $8 million.
Among the factors that have deeply depressed Democratic fund-rasing so far are the recession, President Bush's strong standing in the polls for much of 1991, the lateness of many candidates' entry into the race, and uncertainty about the intentions of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
Alone among Democrats, Mr. Cuomo is thought to have powerful fund-raising potential, and he would begin the race with a sizable warchest left over from his New York re-election campaign.
The one candidate with even fewer money problems is President Bush.
Two events held last month in Dallas and Houston brought in more than $2 million; a Nov. 12 New York luncheon raised $2.2 million and a gala last week at a Washington hotel added more than $1 million.
The president's early fund-raising advantage could well be doubly damaging to Democrats.
That's because the federal matching campaign fund, which is financed through a $1 checkoff on federal tax returns, is strapped for cash; the president could deplete the fund by qualifying for larger pay-outs early in the primary cycle.
Qualifying candidates will receive their first matching funds in January.","Each of the six Democrats who are vying to become his party's nominee for the president wants to be seen as an ""outsider"".
Even so, they are quick to go inside the beltway to raise the money necessary to fund their campaigns.

But the campaign certainly hasn't spurned financial support from the Washington establishment.
""If you want to be competitive, you have to raise the money,"" Ms. Voles says.
Despite his reputation as a Senate maverick, Mr. Harkin appears to be the 1990 candidate favored by Washington's lobbying community, the spawning ground for many of the Democratic Party's mightiest fund-raisers.
Mr. Harkin's wife, Ruth, is a lawyer-lobbyist at one of the city's most prominent Democratic law firms, Akin, Gump, Hauer &amp; Feld.
Moreover, Sen. Harkin's important positions on the Senate Appropriations and Agriculture Committees are lobbying-intensive.
The Washington firms headed by Mr. Cassidy and Mr. McAuliffe both lobby the appropriations committees extensively.
Mr. McAuliffe says his support for Mr. Harkin has nothing to do with his business activities -- Mr. McAuliffe himself doesn't lobby -- and grows out of friendship.
A spokesman for Mr. Cassidy says he, too, is supporting Mr. Harkin because he is an old friend.
Both men were big supporters of Mr. Harkin's Senate bids.
Sen. Harkin is by no means the only Democrat reaching inside the Beltway for campaign help.
Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor who has emphasized his southern, outside-of-Washington base, has an array of notables serving on his campaign's executive committee.
The group includes Anne Wexler, a former Carter White House aide who heads the Wexler Group, a lobbying powerhouse.
Robert Farmer, a former Democratic Party treasurer who was chief fund-raiser for Michael Dukakis and was, until recently, a member of the Cassidy firm, is raising funds for Mr. Clinton, as is Charles Dolan, another Cassidy lobbyist.
Democratic lawyer David Ifshin, who also advises the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), is the campaign's general counsel.
The Clinton campaign raised $100,000 last month at a cocktail party at the home of Vic Raiser, a politically connected Washington lawyer and also a former Democratic Party treasurer.
Even with anti-Washington voter sentiment running strong, Ms. Wexler says the demand for seasoned campaign strategists and fund-raisers is still strong among Democratic presidential candidates.
""There is something to be said for an institutional memory and experience,"" Ms. Wexler says.
""It isn't a question of insiders or outsiders.""
Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska has fewer ties to Washington insiders.
However, he has appointed John Quinn, a Washington lawyer-lobbyist and veteran of other Democratic presidential efforts, as his campaign's general counsel.
Mr. Quinn, in turn, has brought other Washington lawyers onto the Kerrey team.
The Kerrey campaign will have its own Spy Club fund-raiser, for a more modest $50 a ticket, early next month.
Mr. Quinn, for one, says he is comforted by the absence of other Washington insiders on the Kerrey bench.
""The inside-the-Beltway political community has the best record of being wrong,"" he observes.
In 1988, many Democratic lobbyists flocked to the unsuccessful campaign of Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, a powerful member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the future House majority leader.
Mr. McAuliffe, in fact, was Mr. Gephardt's chief fund-raiser.
Despite his relative paucity of connections with the Washington establishment, Sen. Kerrey does have an in with another important community: Hollywood, where he is best known for his relationship with actress Debra Winger.
Last week, Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc., a unit of News Corp., Sydney, Australia, hosted a Kerrey fund-raising event at his Beverly Hills home.
Among the co-hosts of the $250,000-plus event were Hollywood notables Ted Field, David Geffen and Sherry Lansing.
Former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas, who himself did some Washington lobbying for his law firm, based in Boston, has a number of Washington lawyer-lobbyists helping him with fund-raising.
Douglas Wilder, the Virginia governor, is relying on Robert Blair, another wellknown Washington lawyer-lobbyist, to help raise money.
Even former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who has made running against special interests and the Washington establishment the centerpiece of his campaign, has a few Washington politicos working on his campaign.
But Mr. Brown isn't accepting contributions of more than $100.
Some of the Democratic Party's most experienced campaign veterans are still standing on the sidelines.
Richard Moe, a former top adviser to Walter Mondale and an attorney in the Washington office of Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell, says he's taking a ""self-imposed sabbatical"" from politics these days.
Michael Berman, another Washington lawyer-lobbyist who was a top aide to Mr. Mondale, says he has offered advice to several candidates at their request, but will wait until the Democratic convention to become immersed in the presidential campaign.
Thomas Donilon, another Washington attorney and campaign veteran, is also eschewing presidential politics for the moment.
The Washington insiders who have already affiliated with campaigns have their work cut out for them.
According to the most recent Federal Election Commission filings, the Democratic presidential candidates, as of Sept. 30, had together raised only $2.3 million.
At the same point four years ago, five Democrats had each raised more than $2 million, with Michael Dukakis topping $8 million.
Among the factors that have deeply depressed Democratic fund-rasing so far are the recession, President Bush's strong standing in the polls for much of 1991, the lateness of many candidates' entry into the race, and uncertainty about the intentions of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
Alone among Democrats, Mr. Cuomo is thought to have powerful fund-raising potential, and he would begin the race with a sizable warchest left over from his New York re-election campaign.
The one candidate with even fewer money problems is President Bush.
Two events held last month in Dallas and Houston brought in more than $2 million; a Nov. 12 New York luncheon raised $2.2 million and a gala last week at a Washington hotel added more than $1 million.
The president's early fund-raising advantage could well be doubly damaging to Democrats.
That's because the federal matching campaign fund, which is financed through a $1 checkoff on federal tax returns, is strapped for cash; the president could deplete the fund by qualifying for larger pay-outs early in the primary cycle.
Qualifying candidates will receive their first matching funds in January.","Democratic presidential candidates, while claiming outsider status, nevertheless employ Washington insider lawyer-lobbyists to raise money for their campaigns.
Senator Tom Harkin, Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Robert Kerrey rely on DC lobbyists and Kerrey has a strong Hollywood connection, too.
Senator Tsongas, Gerry Brown and Douglas Wilder also employ Washington lawyer-lobbyists or politicos for their fund-raising efforts.
Democrats are behind in fundraising this year due to the recession, Bush's high ratings and the late entry of other candidates, particularly Governor Cuomo, while Mr. Bush has raised over $5 million for Republicans.","[[454, 491], [523, 594], [1056, 1062], [2023, 2035], [2037, 2040], [2050, 2058], [2120, 2170], [2181, 2190], [2192, 2222], [2285, 2306], [2494, 2539], [3197, 3215], [3276, 3333], [4386, 4420], [4494, 4517], [4583, 4587], [4593, 4600], [4753, 4767], [4792, 4805], [4820, 4885], [4915, 4926], [5041, 5095], [5995, 6009], [6023, 6033], [6051, 6088], [6090, 6122], [6129, 6175], [6218, 6245], [6253, 6310], [6312, 6357], [6376, 6414], [6746, 6750], [6801, 6832], [6834, 6835], [6853, 6892], [6925, 6951]]"

Mr. Crane finds Mr. Barro's view, that we should have confidence in the wisdom of the electoral process, naive and dewey-eyed.
Mr. Crane strongly supports term limits because: 1.
Less time in Washington with constant press attention would permit less press corruption of common sense and growth in self-importance.
Indeed, some congressmen feel their opinions should be codified.
2.
Short terms would allow congressmen seniority sooner and be less likely to interrupt productive careers, indeed become a ""leave of absence,"" giving Congress a greater diversity.","[[0, 9], [14, 61], [2369, 2384], [159, 267], [314, 363], [448, 520], [453, 471], [546, 576], [1463, 1483], [1588, 1759], [1463, 1483], [1850, 1921], [1954, 2062]]"
"President Bush is in deep trouble, the panelists agree, hotly pursued in New Hampshire by his conservative challenger, columnist and TV commentator Patrick Buchanan.
The Democratic line-up, composed of second-and-third-tier candidates, is the weakest in years, they say.
Yet, because the economy is in such distress, the panelists expect a close and interesting contest, with Mr. Bush stumbling across the line in first place over the probable Democratic nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
The panelists offer some formulas for judging the year's political events that begin with the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18.
""The problem threshold in New Hampshire is 37%,"" says maverick GOP theoretician Kevin Phillips.
He means that when an opponent of an incumbent president gets that much or more of the New Hampshire vote, the incumbent is forced into pulling out of the race or goes on to lose the general election.
He points to Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.
But none of the panelists is prepared to say that Mr. Bush is necessarily fated to follow in the footsteps of those victims of the New Hampshire primary.
Democratic strategist Greg Schneiders figures it this way:
Multiply the rate of economic growth in this year's third quarter by three to get Mr. Bush's winning -- or losing -- November margin.
If the gross national product growth rate is minus one, he loses by three points.
If it's zero, it's a dead heat.
If it's plus one, he wins by three.
Mr. Bush is off to a terrible start, the panelists agree.
First of all, they say, he shouldn't be offering so many ""mea culpas"" about his record in office.
""It's crazy,"" says Mr. Phillips.
Where President Reagan was the Teflon man, to whom nothing stuck, Mr. Bush ""is now the Velcro man.
He will absorb anything that goes wrong.""
It's one thing to acknowledge responsibility ""when the damage is over and the recovery has begun,"" says Mr. Schneiders.
""But if you do a mea culpa in the middle of an economic free fall, I think it can turn out to be a disaster.""
If Ronald Reagan were president today, says Democratic strategist Alan Baron, he'd be getting less blame for the collapse of the economy and more residual glory for the successful prosecution of the war in the Gulf.
Mr. Bush's two most recent trips -- 12 days in Asia followed by 12 hours in New Hampshire -- were both unsuccessful, the panelists agree.
""I can't understand him taking the president of General Motors and the presidents of all these other companies over there,"" says Mr. Baron.
""That was silly.
It takes away his independence.""
As for the campaign trip to New Hampshire, Mr. Baron believes that by going there the president helped to make the primary a legitimate race between himself and Mr. Buchanan.
Mr. Bush, the panelists say, is a better president than he is a candidate and hasn't helped himself lately by operating almost exclusively in his high-pitched campaign mode.
""I'm just glad that he's not trying to wage a war right now, because it would be a disaster,"" says Mr. Schneiders.
""The president is in free fall in the polls,"" says Mr. Sears, ""and because he doesn't have a personal constituency there's no bottom to it.""
Mr. Sears says, one way or another, he had better hit that bottom fast and start clambering back up to respectability.
Mr. Buchanan poses a special and very dangerous threat, the panelists agree.
""He seems to understand that he should tailor himself to be a message carrier,"" says Mr. Sears.
""It's a free vote for Republicans in New Hampshire,"" notes Mr. Baron.
""Those voters know the difference between primary voting and voting for a president.""
Mr. Schneiders argues that ""there's a very scary part of Pat Buchanan that pops to the surface from time to time.
You don't have to be a crazy liberal to get chills every once in a while at the things he says.""
But the panelists all agree it would be a serious miscalculation if the Bush campaign attacked Mr. Buchanan for his right-wing views.
""If Buchanan does well,"" says Mr. Baron, ""let the press do it.""
But even if Mr. Bush does well and keeps Mr. Buchanan below 25% of the vote, Mr. Bush doesn't win a famous victory.
""I mean, beating a columnist]"" says Mr. Schneiders.
The best news for the Republicans, the panelists say, is that none of the current crop of Democrats seeking the nomination looks very impressive.
""If the Democrats had a strong first-tier candidate in the race at this point, I suspect he would have a good chance of winning"" in November, says Mr. Phillips.
But at the moment, he says, ""I don't think {the Democrats will} make it this time unless one of these guys gets a lot better or the economy sinks to another degree.""
The strongest of the five major Democratic candidates is Gov. Clinton, the panelists agree.
They write off former California Gov. Jerry Brown and they don't see Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa making progress.
The alternatives to Mr. Clinton in New Hampshire likely will be Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska or, as a kind of temporary holding-action candidate, former Sen. Paul Tsongas of neighboring Massachusetts.
""My sense is that Clinton will emerge and run a very respectable race in which he begins to sort out for the Democratic Party the divisions that it's in the process of outgrowing,"" Mr. Phillips says.
But Mr. Clinton, or any other Democrat, needs to get better and the economy needs to get worse for Mr. Bush to be placed in really serious jeopardy.
""If Clinton wins New Hampshire by five or six points, I think he'll be the nominee,"" Mr. Sears predicts.
But the other panelists aren't so sure.
Mr. Schneiders sees a scenario in which Mr. Clinton stumbles one way or another or comes under criticism in the press and begins losing a primary here, a primary there.
Maybe, says Mr. Schneiders, a toptier candidate -- possibly Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York -- jumps into the race and all the dynamics change.
The other panelists are skeptical anything like that might happen.
And yet they agree that this will be a year of extraordinary volatility.
In the general election, the panelists say, Mr. Bush might not be able to win very many points for winning the war in the Gulf.
""Barring a crisis,"" says Mr. Schneiders, the war, and foreign policy generally, ""won't be major issues.""
But Mr. Phillips thinks that with Saddam Hussein still in power and with the old Soviet Union breaking into pieces, ""there's still a lot of ways"" in which foreign policy could become an issue.
Mr. Sears thinks it's possible the Democrats could actually take Mr. Bush on over the fact that Saddam Hussein is still in power.
""The man is still there,"" Mr. Sears notes.
""At a certain point, rather than just beat up on the economy, the Democrats would be wise testing Bush's diminished credibility in this area.""
Though the Democrats lack a candidate with foreign-policy credentials, they can approach the subject obliquely -- by emphasizing trade, talking about how the U.S. is losing jobs to foreign competitors and complaining that the U.S. is in economic decline.
""It all feeds together,"" says Mr. Phillips.
But there will be only one really big issue: the state of the economy.
They all agree on that.","A panel of political experts, meeting as the New Hampshire primary nears, agree that no candidate is doing well.
They say that President Bush is off to terrible start, and that he faces a challenge from Pat Buchanan in New Hampshire where he has little to win and a lot to lose.
