"The communist world gets its first McDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whether its American hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food treat, Pljeskavica.
The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrade's main downtown squares will take place March 24, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fries and the other specialities familiar to McDonald's customers in the West.
The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of the American restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.
Pljeskavica is made of ground pork and onions, and it is served on bread and eaten with the hands.
It is sold at fast-food restaurants across the country and costs about a dollar.
""In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica,"" said an official of Genex, Yugoslavia's largest state-run enterprise that will operate the McDonald's.
John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters, said it was the first of the chain's outlets in a communist country.
The next East European McDonald's is scheduled to be opened in Budapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic, another Genex official.

"Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused the United States of threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinian guerrillas attack American targets.
The United States denied the accusation.
The State Department said in Washington that it had received reports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S. involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's second in command.
Wazir was slain April 16 during a raid on his house near Tunis, Tunisia.
Israeli officials who spoke on condition they not be identified said an Israeli squad carried out the assassination.
There have been accusations by the PLO that the United States knew about and approved plans for slaying Wazir.
Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, claimed the threat to kill PLO officials was made in a U.S. government document the PLO obtained from an Arab government.
He refused to identify the government.
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy denied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLO officials.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States has been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries about possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
He added that Arafat's interpretation of those contacts was ""entirely without foundation.""
Arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villa in Baghdad, where extra security guards have been deployed.
He said security also was being augmented at PLO offices around the Arab world following the alleged threat.
He produced a photocopy of the alleged document.
It appeared to be part of a longer document with the word ""CONFIDENTIAL"" stamped at the bottom.
The document, which was typewritten in English, referred to Wazir by his code name, Abu Jihad.
It read: ""You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern and particulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approved Abu Jihad's assassination.
""On April 18th (a) State Department spokesman said that the United States `condemns this act of political assassination,' `had no knowledge of' and `was not involved in any way in this assassination.
""It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafat may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against American citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliation for last month's assassination of Abu Jihad.
""Any possible targeting of American personnel and facilities in retaliation for Abu Jihad's assassination would be totally reprehensible and unjustified.
We would hold the PLO responsible for any such attacks.""
Arafat said the document ""reveals the U.S. administration is planning, in full cooperation with the Israelis, to conduct a crusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the PLO for them.
""These attacks will then be used to justify the assassination of PLO leaders.""

West German police said one pilot was killed in the in-flight crash.
The Air Force spokeswoman, Capt.
Gail Hayes, said the aircraft were on a training mission when they crashed near Bodenheim, about six miles south of Mainz.
She said the aircraft, assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Base, crashed at 1:30 p.m. ""There was one person aboard each aircraft.

""The other pilot was able to eject safely,"" Lenxweiler said.
Lenxweiler said he did not know if the pilot who ejected suffered any injuries.
Identities of the pilots were not immediately released.
He said the planes crashed within several hundred yards of a populated area but that no one on the ground was hurt.
He said preliminary information indicated that one of the F-16s rammed the other from behind.
Both planes exploded on impact, he said.

"Three hours of steady rain Monday afternoon provided a much-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared 1,650 acres in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rainfall in neighboring Yellowstone National Park calmed three smaller fires there.
Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in California over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day fire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday after the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.
About a quarter-inch of rain helped to keep the lightning-caused Shoshone fire's growth to about 200 acres overnight, said fire information officer Dave Damron.
But the nearly quarter-inch of rain that fell Monday held it to 1,650 acres, he said.
The rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100-man patrol planned for Monday night.
""The forecast for the next two or three days is dry, with lower humidities and conditions more favorable to burning,"" said Damron.
""But this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforce the lines and complete lines that we don't have yet.""
Four 20-person firefighting crews from Colorado, Utah and South Dakota were expected to arrive at the fire by Monday night, putting the total number of firefighters at about 430.
Crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air, Damron said, as four helicopters and three air tankers dropped chemical retardant and water on the spreading flames.
On the ground firefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers.
Meanwhile at Yellowstone, park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said that because the three fires there all were in the backcountry, no firefighters were trying to douse the flames.
Because of the fires, park officials Sunday had closed off some areas, but Vanderbilt said Monday the rain had allowed the reopening of the areas to hiking and camping.
The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, near Yosemite, was a ""bottle rocket,"" said the forest's spokeswoman, Mary Hale.
Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity, reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon and hoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning, Hale said.
The fire was the largest so far this year in the forest, which was the scene of huge wildfires last summer.
At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawatha forest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said from the national forest's headquarters in Escanaba, Mich.
""We're going to start releasing crews from this fire,"" Bluedorn said.
""We'll continue to patrol the area to make sure we didn't miss any hot spots.""
Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeks before the fire is extinguished.
""It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain,"" he said.
The Fourth of July was no holiday for firefighters from national forests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho and other states who were shipped to Michigan's central Upper Peninsula to battle the Hiawatha blaze, Bluedorn said.
Forest Service officials, meanwhile, began assessing damage to the 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlands burned after the fire broke out Friday afternoon, Bluedorn said.
Investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause.","Sixty Forest Service firefighters brought Michigan's four-day Hiawatha National Forest fire under control after it burned 1100 acres of woodlands.
Firefighters were brought in from several states over the Fourth of July holiday to help fight the blaze.
Elsewhere, overnight rain helped limit the growth of the Shoshone National Forest fire in Wyoming that has burned 1650 acres so far.
The rain provided a reprieve to the 430 firefighters who are fighting the blaze from the air with helicopters and three air tankers and on the ground with four bulldozers.
Fires in Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks are also being contained.","[[437, 489], [511, 557], [2379, 2430], [2438, 2456], [2874, 2888], [2896, 2903], [2908, 2925], [2946, 2990], [2995, 3007], [3046, 3059], [3069, 3074], [134, 169], [583, 606], [624, 646], [666, 675], [773, 795], [806, 814], [1032, 1042], [1053, 1061], [1284, 1319], [1332, 1383], [1401, 1439], [1559, 1574], [199, 224], [1589, 1600], [1674, 1701], [1981, 1989], [2144, 2164]]"

At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawatha forest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said from the national forest's headquarters in Escanaba, Mich.
""We're going to start releasing crews from this fire,"" Bluedorn said.
""We'll continue to patrol the area to make sure we didn't miss any hot spots.""
Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeks before the fire is extinguished.
""It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain,"" he said.
The Fourth of July was no holiday for firefighters from national forests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho and other states who were shipped to Michigan's central Upper Peninsula to battle the Hiawatha blaze, Bluedorn said.
Forest Service officials, meanwhile, began assessing damage to the 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlands burned after the fire broke out Friday afternoon, Bluedorn said.
Investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause.","Three hours of steady rain Monday provided a much-needed edge to crews working to douse a blaze in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming.
Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in California over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day fire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday.
Four 20-person crews from Colorado, Utah and South Dakota were expected to arrive at the Shoshone fire by Monday night, putting the total number of firefighters to 430.
At least 60 firefighters brought the Hiawatha forest fire under control Monday.","[[0, 33], [44, 106], [131, 169], [259, 408], [410, 510], [624, 637], [1142, 1156], [1170, 1264], [1266, 1319], [2370, 2381], [2397, 2463]]"
"Three hours of steady rain Monday afternoon provided a much-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared 1,650 acres in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rainfall in neighboring Yellowstone National Park calmed three smaller fires there.
Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in California over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day fire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday after the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.
About a quarter-inch of rain helped to keep the lightning-caused Shoshone fire's growth to about 200 acres overnight, said fire information officer Dave Damron.
But the nearly quarter-inch of rain that fell Monday held it to 1,650 acres, he said.
The rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100-man patrol planned for Monday night.
""The forecast for the next two or three days is dry, with lower humidities and conditions more favorable to burning,"" said Damron.
""But this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforce the lines and complete lines that we don't have yet.""
Four 20-person firefighting crews from Colorado, Utah and South Dakota were expected to arrive at the fire by Monday night, putting the total number of firefighters at about 430.
Crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air, Damron said, as four helicopters and three air tankers dropped chemical retardant and water on the spreading flames.
On the ground firefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers.
Meanwhile at Yellowstone, park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said that because the three fires there all were in the backcountry, no firefighters were trying to douse the flames.
Because of the fires, park officials Sunday had closed off some areas, but Vanderbilt said Monday the rain had allowed the reopening of the areas to hiking and camping.
The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, near Yosemite, was a ""bottle rocket,"" said the forest's spokeswoman, Mary Hale.
Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity, reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon and hoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning, Hale said.

"A lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says its developer.
""It would probably not falsely accuse any innocent people, and it would probably pick up 70 to 90 percent of guilty people,"" says J. Peter Rosenfeld, a Northwestern University professor of psychology and of neurobiology and physiology.
""I think that's better than existing units.""
The American Medical Association and the congressional Office of Technology Assessment have said polygraphs are wrong 15 percent to 50 percent of the time.
Rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, amplifying the signals and feeding them into a computer, which coordinates the information and displays it on a video screen.
""If sensory information has a special meaning for you ... then your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3 wave,"" he said.
In tests at Northwestern, subjects have been asked to look at a series of words, most with no special meaning.
""Occasionally, they'll see a word that is meaningful, like some anti-social act they're involved in _ cheating on tests or using drugs _ which is sometimes the case here,"" Rosenfeld said.
""When they see terms like that, their brain waves break into P3 waves.""
Polygraphs measure the physical expression of emotions _
pulse, sweating, blood pressure and breathing, he said.
Advertising researchers have measured P3 waves to better gauge what consumers want instead of what they say they want, and psychiatrists can detect certain disorders, such as attention deficits, by measuring them, he said.
Rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and says it could be widely used within three more.
He published a study last year and will publish another this summer in the International Journal of Neuroscience.
""It's a perfectly valid way of detecting lies,"" said Sidney Weinstein, a professor of neurology at New York University College of Medicine in New York City and editor of the Danbury, Conn.-based neuroscience journal.
However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.","The American Medical Association and the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment have said that polygraphs give a false report as often as 50 percent of the time.
A professor of psychology and neurobiology is developing a lie detector that measures brain waves, rather than bodily functions, as do the polygraphs now in use.
He claims that it will pick up 70 to 90 percent of those lying, and will falsely accuse no one.
The developer also said that the new detector will be on the market in four years, and it will cost ten times as much as the polygraph machines now in use.","[[414, 531], [543, 569], [0, 131], [309, 352], [134, 255], [258, 281], [2138, 2166], [2180, 2195]]"
"Weather experts discussed the drought Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and said they hoped to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last.
All of the speakers at the 1988 Drought Symposium called for more research and study.
""There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase.
The next business of the scientist is to eliminate the possibilities of ... and extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect,"" said David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington.
The symposium attended by 13 state and national experts was sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live.
John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season.
Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane season.
He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable, depending on the intensity and speed of the storm.
Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their rainfall in some months from hurricanes.
Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer told the symposium he thought the position of the planet Jupiter had something to do with drought in the Southeast.
However, Rodenhuis said he was skeptical about Plummer's thesis.

"Gilbert, an ""extremely dangerous hurricane"" and one of the strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.
The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in the Dominican Republic, civil defense officials said.
Six people died and 60,000 were left homeless in Jamaica on Monday, officials there said.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga said the hurricane swept the full length of Jamaica, ""leaving a trail of wreckage behind it.""
""It will take us some time before we can assess the full damage without any doubt,"" Seaga said in a statement.
""But I have no doubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we have experienced in our modern history.""
Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and the death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and casualty reports.
The hurricane, traveling westward across the Caribbean Sea, was upgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane.
Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., described Gilbert as ""a great hurricane ... in the top 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size and destructive potential.""
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _
a 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.
""The people who need to be concerned now are those people over on the Yucatan Peninsula _
Cancun, Cozumel, that whole area,"" Sheets said.
Mexico's news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated in the Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel Island.
They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said people in Cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center, about 6 miles away.
Cozumel is south of Cancun and the reports said hotel guests also were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline.
Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morning hours Wednesday.
At midnight EDT the U.S. National Weather Service said Gilbert was centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, or about 150 miles east-southeast of Cozumel.
It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph.
The center said tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center.
""People in the warned areas should have completed all possible preparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane,"" it said.
The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
It said by 8 p.m. EDT it was measured at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
""That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere,"" said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
""There is very serious flooding"" in the Cayman Islands, Erina Nichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speaking with residents of the islands.
""The Run Point (community) is taking a real beating.""
The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the Cayman Islands, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting 12-foot tides.
Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla., said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboard missing near the Cayman Islands.
Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc. in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 helipads were working at full capacity to evacuate about 10,000 oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 40,000 people, many of them foreign vacationers and students, were evacuated Tuesday from the Isle of Youth off the southwestern coast as the hurricane passed 200 miles to the south.
In New York City, a ham radio operator who was monitoring amateur radio communications in Jamaica said Tuesday, ""Kingston is devastated, Montego Bay is hit hard and Ocho Rios is flooded.""
The operator, Norm Chwat, an officer with the American Red Cross Radio Club, said therth coast had been wrecked by the hurricane.
Herb Schoenbaum, a radio ham operator in the Virgin Islands, said he spoke Tuesday with Dave Porter, an American staying in the Wyndham Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay.
""Porter reported that the hotel `peeled apart like a banana' when the force of Hurricane Gilbert hit last night,"" Schoenbaum said.
""This morning he says there is just nothing left.
Boats that were on the beach, the little rental Sailfishes or Sunfishes, were driven into cars like spears _ power lines down, almost every tree in the area is on the ground.""
Schoenbaum said Porter told him people who were trying to enter the hotel on their hands and knees at the height of the storm were swept into the ocean.
Glenn Baxter of Belgrade Lakes, Me., said he spoke with a ham operator in Jamaica who told him the roof of a hospital in Mandeville ripped off ""and the hospital has caved in.
And that is the worst horror show that I've heard about because that would imply that a lot of people could have been hurt.""
The Jamaican consulate in Miami said today it had n immediate information on the extent of damages or casualties.
Jamaica was still out of contact with the rest of the world by telephone.
Roger Myers, southern regional spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta, said both international airports in Jamaica are closed.
""We've been told the government has asked commercial radio stations to remain silent so Radio Jamaica can broadcast information,"" Myers said.","Hurricane Gilbert, a category 5, one of the strongest storms in history battered the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.

"A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ""totally fiction,"" Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.
""It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license.
I don't see John in there ...
It's a very dramatically described something, but it's not about John,""
Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.
The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's ""The Lives of John Lennon,"" which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.
As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of Lennon's death.
Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.
Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.
""It's totally fiction,"" Yoko said during the hour-long program, which opened with Lennon's song, ""Gimme Some Truth,"" and coincided with the book's national release Wednesday.
""These people in this book are not us.
It's not John and me,""
Ono continued.
""It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hit back.
...
For some reason this book is attempting to rob both John and I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to.""
The Ono interview was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where the Lennons lived _ and Yoko still lives with their son, Sean.
Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8, 1980.
The interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One Network; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how many stations picked up the broadcast was not available.
Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian.
Ono was interviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described in Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko _
a charge Mintz denied during the show.
""It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies, untruths ...
The whole thing is just sickening,"" said Julian, who also refuted Goldman's tales of Lennon as a violent father.
Mintz read excerpts from the book to Yoko, who then responded to the allegations point by point.
She denied that Lennon was homosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with his son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll Howard Hughes.
She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a $5,000-a-week habit.
The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of the book.
After Yoko's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900-digit telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate portrayal of the Lennons' life.
Results were not expected until later today.

Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreau Sodre of Brazil told the opening session of the 42nd General Assembly that the Third World economic picture was dimming ""due to the lack of progress in international economic relations.""
""It is ... sad to note that we, American, Asian, African brothers, still suffer from the same horrors and the same desolation which so badly affected our forebears,"" he said, adding, ""hunger ... is endemically spreading throughout the continents.""

"Ben Johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion, without the Olympic gold medal and the hero's welcome, as Canadians bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test.
Returning to Canada on Tuesday, Johnson, 26, dodged reporters and the public, refusing to talk about the muscle-building and illegal steroid Stanzolol found in his system after he won the 100-meter dash as the world's fastest human.
But on the flight from South Korea, he denied using the drugs even though Olympic officials said the results were indisputable.
""I got nothing to hide,"" Johnson told The Boston Globe during the flight to New York, where he then boarded another plane for Canada.
""I don't want to tell no names, but somebody's smiling today.""
""It's not the only thing in life to win a gold medal,"" Johnson said.
""I still have my parents.
My family still loves me.""
Stripped of the gold and banned for life from Canadian teams, Johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his mother's home in suburban Toronto after the grueling trip from Seoul.
""There's no gold now, just disappointment,"" said Boyd Plaxton, 26, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when Johnson's plane landed.
""If he had come home with the gold in tact, there would have been a million people here,"" Plaxton said.
Chaos spoiled a gilt-edged moment for a man who had run 100 meters in the fastest time ever, 9.79 seconds.
Johnson, surrounded by a phalanx of security guards, ducked into a car and made a mad dash for the door when he arrived at the house.
But he apparently forgot his key and had to return 20 minutes later with his shirt over his head.
Johnson spent the 1 hour, 40 minute flight from New York in the plane's cockpit to avoid reporters.
On the way to New York, however, he stayed in the passenger cabin, appearing calm throughout the flight, the Globe said.
As passengers realized who he was, some sought autographs.
A group of flight attendants swarmed around Johnson for a photo.
""First I was shocked, but after a while, I don't care,"" Johnson said when asked what he felt after he was informed he had failed the drug test.
In Canada, a parade in his adopted hometown was canceled, and promoters backed out of deals or announced their ties with the sprinter would expire quietly.
Sports Minister Jean Charest said Johnson had tested negative for drugs in August and had passed eight tests in two years.
He called the stripping of the medal a ""national embarrassment.""
Johnson's family and close friends also denied he took steroids ""I know my son doesn't take drugs.
I know he hasn't done it.
I know it,"" said his father, Ben Johnson Sr., from Falmouth, Jamaica, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail.
""Ben loved mom too much to discredit her in any way,"" said his sister, Claire Rodney, of suburban Toronto.
Johnson had dedicated his gold to his mother, Gloria, and the Canadian people.
It was surrendered to Canadian Olympic officials before the family left South Korea on Monday.
""Right now he's just relieved to be resting at home.
He wants to be with people who love him now, not the hypocrites who abandoned him,"" Ms. Rodney said outside her mother's house.
""He looks great.
Being at home is the best medicine for him,"" said Ms. Rodney.
""My brother is not a druggie.""
His personal physician, Dr. George Astaphan, also said no steroids were dispensed.
""I never gave him any, and he never told me he took any,"" Astaphan said in an interview in a baggage claim area.
Hundreds of Canadians rallied to the sprinter's side.
Police escorted a woman to the door of Johnson's mother's home so she could deliver a card with more than 1,000 signatures from Canadians ""who sympathized with your personal devastation.""
In Toronto, a group of restaurant employees chipped in about $350 to charter a plane that circled the city with a banner proclaiming: ""We believe you, Ben.""
In Montreal, Johnson's fans said they were disappointed.
""The last flicker of hope just died,"" said Danny Planetta, who was watching TV at a bar when he heard Monday night that Johnson had tested positive for steroids.

"Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
""Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition,"" hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night.
""The senator is expected to make a full recovery.""
Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said.
A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas.
Thursday's surgery took approximately three hours, Habgood said.
When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed.
Tests of that growth showed it to contain some ""malignant but well differentiated cells,"" Habgood said.
Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said.
After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant.
He also served as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra investigative panel.

"U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating Emperor Hirohito in war crimes, a television documentary claims.
The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which were released Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S. prosecutors worked with the emperor's aides to find a way to avoid putting Hirohito on trial.
The documentary challenges Hirohito's image as a peaceful man forced to go along with his generals' plans and alleges among other things that he: _Must have known about the massacre of at least 20,000 Chinese at Nanking in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports from the China front.

Behr is a Paris-based journalist.
His biography of China's last monarch was used for the award-winning film ""The Last Emperor.""
It has been reported previously that American prosecutors wanted to keep Hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked Tojo to suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the advice of the High Command.
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupying Japan, wrote in his book ""Reminiscences"" that he fended off pressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito, arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.
Behr told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday that the documentary will be shown in the United States by PBS on March 13.

"The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m., just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated.
Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
""They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get home,"" said Capt. Steven Karalekas.
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.
The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated.
The center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.
When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier.
The somber mood was heightened by the lack of bands, and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked.
Adm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was on the dock to greet the vessel.
As it docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.
The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the crewmen.
The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday.
The tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.
The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber ""bloomers"" that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.
The videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.
Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.
""We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way,"" said Cmdr.
John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station.
""Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death.""
A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar.
Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost Soviet submarine ""put political differences aside and unite the human family as one.""
On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.
The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.
None of the victims listed the Norfolk area as their hometown.
The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico.
The Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired.
The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.
The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.
But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The New York Times reported Sunday.
This indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing unidentified sources.
Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said.
They said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.
They were recommissioned by the Reagan administration in the 1980s.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion.
""They are effective, they were relatively cheap to bring back into the service compared to new ships, they are good cruise missile platforms, so I think they do have a role to play,"" Cheney said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
Critics have charged that the battleship's 16-inch guns are antiquated and dangerous; gunners say they are among the most accurate available.","The battleship Iowa was welcomed back to Norfolk Naval Base on Sunday by 3000 silent family and friends.
Sailors with black arm bands lined the rails.
Two of the 11 crew members who survived the explosion that killed 47 stood on the blackened No.2 turret, with full crews on the other two.
Media were kept from families and crew.
A video of the explosion was released on Sunday.
The still-open gun breech, and flame and gases reaching lower decks, suggest the explosion occurred while powder was in transit from a powder hoist to the gun.

"The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m., just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated.
Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
""They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get home,"" said Capt. Steven Karalekas.
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.
The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated.
The center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.
When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier.
The somber mood was heightened by the lack of bands, and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked.
Adm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was on the dock to greet the vessel.
As it docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.
The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the crewmen.
The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday.
The tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.
The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber ""bloomers"" that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.
The videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.
Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.
""We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way,"" said Cmdr.
John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station.
""Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death.""
A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar.
Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost Soviet submarine ""put political differences aside and unite the human family as one.""
On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.
The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.
None of the victims listed the Norfolk area as their hometown.
The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico.
The Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired.
The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.
The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.
But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The New York Times reported Sunday.
This indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing unidentified sources.
Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said.
They said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.
They were recommissioned by the Reagan administration in the 1980s.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion.
""They are effective, they were relatively cheap to bring back into the service compared to new ships, they are good cruise missile platforms, so I think they do have a role to play,"" Cheney said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

"An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to childhood neighbors followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television reruns and her influence on comedy.
The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
She was 77 and died eight days after emergency heart surgery.
A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes.
""God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever,"" said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope.
Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and thousands of cards after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise said.
Miss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients.
Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was critically ill.
Following her operation last week, her first words to her daughter, Lucie, were: ""Wouldn't you know _
this is the day I was going to get my hair done.""
Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came as a shock.
""She had been walking, her spirits were up.
Her family was with her,"" Wise said.
""She responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery.""
He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta.
Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in ""I Love Lucy"" from 1951 to 1957.
In the ground-breaking show, still seen in syndication worldwide, the late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
""Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do,"" said actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom ""Kate and Allie.""
""But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her shows.""
The show, one of the most popular in television history, was distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls.
""Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in comedy,"" recalled Joan Rivers.
""What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime.""
Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said: ""Lucy was great because she represented every person.
She showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves.""
Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the ""I Love Lucy"" characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.
""That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant,"" Miss Goldberg said.
""She was looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously.
And that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy.""
Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of ""I Love Lucy"" on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words ""In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989"" appeared.
""I felt I had lost someone in my family.
I couldn't believe it,"" said Rosati, 40.
""I was watching Lucy like I do every morning.
She's one of the most-admired ladies in this town.""
He was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss Ball's home on Roxbury Drive as florists delivered baskets of flowers to the house.
Tour vans passed by in a non-stop procession.
On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were placed on Miss Ball's two stars _
one for her film work, one for television.
Budd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said, ""The world of comedy has lost its first lady.
Her death is an irreparable loss ... to our industry.""
Actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series ""Taxi.""
""It made it like it had been blessed,"" he recalled.
Admirers included President Bush, in Southern California at the time of Miss Ball's passing, and former President Reagan.
""Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution,"" the former president and Nancy Reagan said in a statement.
""Just the mention of her name brings a smile. ...
We love Lucy and will miss her deeply.""
""Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter,"" Bush said.
""But she also embodied an even greater treasure _
the gift of love.
She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit.
She was not merely an actress or comedienne.
She was Lucy and she was loved.""
""To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing,"" said ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after ""I Love Lucy"" went off the air as a regular series.
""She didn't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life.""
Said comic Tim Conway: ""We're going to miss this lady, but not really, because she's still here.
All those wonderful things they did together ... those wonderful TV shows ... are still available.""
Although Miss Ball hadn't visited her hometown of Jamestown, N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch with friends.
Irene Rosseti, who now lives in Celoron, N.Y., said Miss Ball recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary.
""Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us,"" she recalled.

"Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets.
Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in southwestern New Mexico, put in containers on mules and horses, loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.
The trout will stay there until the creek rises and becomes ash-free.
""They were in good shape,"" said Toby Martinez, a U.S. Forest Service range and wildlife staff officer for the Gila National Forest.
Officials hoped at least 90 percent would survive.
Much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning-caused Divide fire, which started June 30 and burned about 10,000 acres 150 miles southwest of Albuquerque, said Forest Service spokeswoman Andrea Garcia.
The fire was contained Monday and should be controlled within four days, Ms. Garcia said.
Martinez said rescuers used electric shockers to stun the fish, then netted them.
When a fish is stunned, it comes to the surface.
Gila trout once were widespread throughout mountain streams in the Gila River Basin of southwestern New Mexico, but the habitat was ruined because of wood cutting, overgrazing and irrigation.
The trout was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1967.
Lightning sparked three small fires Thursday and today, but firefighters were extinguishing them today, said Willie Zapata, U.S. Forest Service dispatcher in Gila.
In California, 1,500 firefighters aided by light wind and higher humidity Thursday had circled 70 percent of an arson fire that has charred more than 3,000 acres of scenic California coastline near Big Sur.
Firefighters said they were unable to make progress overnight.
They hoped to have the 6-day-old fire contained by late today, but authorities were concerned that higher temperatures could hamper their efforts.
A brush fire accidentally started by Marine Corps tracer fire continued burning out of control today after charring at least 3,000 acres at Camp Pendleton, a base spokesman said.
Firefighters on Thursday said they had contained the 2,000-acre Livermore Fire west of Fort Collins, Colo., in Roosevelt National Forest, the last of three major fires in Colorado to be encircled by firefighters.
Seven 20-person crews fighting the fire were to be reduced to three crews, officials said.
Earlier, firefighters contained the Black Tiger fire which covered 2,000 acres in Boulder Canyon and destroyed dozens of homes, and halted a 2,600-acre fire in Mesa Verde National Monument in southwestern Colorado.
Arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires, and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained.
The stubborn Horton Fire, burning beneath the Mogollon Rim, had grown to 300 acres, but officials expected to have it contained by late Saturday.
In northwest Nebraska, members of a volunteer fire department and a few National Guardsmen stood by the smoldering remains of a blaze that charred 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge.
The fire, which raged for four days and destroyed 14 unoccupied structures, was contained Wednesday and officials predicted it would be controlled soon.
Forest officials in Nebraska shifted their attention Thursday from firefighting to seeding grass and planting trees.
The blaze blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years old, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Staff Officer Jim Carson.
Carson hoped for rain.
""My experience is that we'd see green grass again if we get enough moisture, say a half-inch of rain,"" he said.
Rains helped firefighters in western Wyoming forests.
The storms dampened a fire in Bridger-Teton National Forest that had burned nearly 3,500 acres.
""It's been real quiet,"" said Dick Heninger, a ranger in the forest's Pinedale office.
""It looks better all the time, the way these clouds are coming in.""
Heninger said four crews will probably be released from the fire today, leaving two to continue mop-up work.
But one official with the Wyoming Interagency Fire Coordination Center warned the break in the fire season will probably be short-lived.

""For now, anyway, we are getting some relief.""","Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets.
Officials said 566 Gila trout, placed on the endangered species list in 1967, were fished out of Diamond Creek and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.
Meanwhile in California, firefighters battled an arson fire that has charred more than 3,000 acres.
Firefighters and National Guardsmen contained one of the larger fires covering 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge in Nebraska on Wednesday.","[[0, 209], [211, 273], [360, 402], [1300, 1313], [1322, 1353], [1519, 1532], [1540, 1552], [1602, 1613], [1628, 1680], [2902, 2904], [2915, 2923], [2925, 2937], [2948, 2967], [2974, 2992], [3049, 3079], [3161, 3180]]"
"Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets.
Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in southwestern New Mexico, put in containers on mules and horses, loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.
The trout will stay there until the creek rises and becomes ash-free.
""They were in good shape,"" said Toby Martinez, a U.S. Forest Service range and wildlife staff officer for the Gila National Forest.
Officials hoped at least 90 percent would survive.
Much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning-caused Divide fire, which started June 30 and burned about 10,000 acres 150 miles southwest of Albuquerque, said Forest Service spokeswoman Andrea Garcia.
The fire was contained Monday and should be controlled within four days, Ms. Garcia said.
Martinez said rescuers used electric shockers to stun the fish, then netted them.
When a fish is stunned, it comes to the surface.
Gila trout once were widespread throughout mountain streams in the Gila River Basin of southwestern New Mexico, but the habitat was ruined because of wood cutting, overgrazing and irrigation.
The trout was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1967.
Lightning sparked three small fires Thursday and today, but firefighters were extinguishing them today, said Willie Zapata, U.S. Forest Service dispatcher in Gila.
In California, 1,500 firefighters aided by light wind and higher humidity Thursday had circled 70 percent of an arson fire that has charred more than 3,000 acres of scenic California coastline near Big Sur.
Firefighters said they were unable to make progress overnight.
They hoped to have the 6-day-old fire contained by late today, but authorities were concerned that higher temperatures could hamper their efforts.
A brush fire accidentally started by Marine Corps tracer fire continued burning out of control today after charring at least 3,000 acres at Camp Pendleton, a base spokesman said.
Firefighters on Thursday said they had contained the 2,000-acre Livermore Fire west of Fort Collins, Colo., in Roosevelt National Forest, the last of three major fires in Colorado to be encircled by firefighters.
Seven 20-person crews fighting the fire were to be reduced to three crews, officials said.
Earlier, firefighters contained the Black Tiger fire which covered 2,000 acres in Boulder Canyon and destroyed dozens of homes, and halted a 2,600-acre fire in Mesa Verde National Monument in southwestern Colorado.
Arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires, and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained.
The stubborn Horton Fire, burning beneath the Mogollon Rim, had grown to 300 acres, but officials expected to have it contained by late Saturday.
In northwest Nebraska, members of a volunteer fire department and a few National Guardsmen stood by the smoldering remains of a blaze that charred 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge.
The fire, which raged for four days and destroyed 14 unoccupied structures, was contained Wednesday and officials predicted it would be controlled soon.
Forest officials in Nebraska shifted their attention Thursday from firefighting to seeding grass and planting trees.
The blaze blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years old, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Staff Officer Jim Carson.
Carson hoped for rain.
""My experience is that we'd see green grass again if we get enough moisture, say a half-inch of rain,"" he said.
Rains helped firefighters in western Wyoming forests.
The storms dampened a fire in Bridger-Teton National Forest that had burned nearly 3,500 acres.
""It's been real quiet,"" said Dick Heninger, a ranger in the forest's Pinedale office.
""It looks better all the time, the way these clouds are coming in.""
Heninger said four crews will probably be released from the fire today, leaving two to continue mop-up work.

The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
""It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,"" McAdie said.
""We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.""
The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance.
Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships.
""We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate,"" Clark said.
In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture.
Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane.
To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane.
Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
""Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,"" Emmanuel said.
Satellites can give a ""pretty picture,"" he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path.
""Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job,"" Emmanuel said.
Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
""We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products,"" Pyke said, ""and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.""","Meteorologists use satellites and supercomputers to track hurricanes.
The resulting models embody all the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and changes.
The path of hurricane Hugo was predicted using this information.
More difficult is predicting changes in intensity.
In Hugo's case, the increased wind speed was detected by Air Force Reconnaissance, upgrading Hugo to a Category 4 hours before it hit Charleston, South Carolina.
Satellite information is fed into computers in Suitland, Maryland, then to the Hurricane Center, where the tracking model constantly changes, following the storm.
Using this data, history and the storm's path, the meteorologists guess the probable landfall.","[[2211, 2246], [2248, 2285], [2299, 2308], [364, 425], [438, 445], [466, 493], [254, 265], [299, 303], [313, 340], [1097, 1150], [836, 850], [958, 962], [1012, 1095], [1355, 1397], [1406, 1433], [1948, 1978], [1980, 1997], [2036, 2049], [2051, 2133], [2137, 2148], [2180, 2210], [2252, 2382], [2389, 2435]]"
"Three decades ago, a West German politician said German reunification was a ""sleeping lioness"" that would awake one day with a mighty roar.
Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate Europe.
""Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years,"" says West German conservative lawmaker Eduard Lintner.
""We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.""
The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German leader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist West has revived international interest in the debate.
Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of German reunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush and something short of a categorical ""no"" from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.
""If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany,"" added the 44-year-old Lintner in an Associated Press interview.
The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but it has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at the end of World War II.
Full national reunification would completey rework the postwar European order mapped out by the conquering Allies.
It is a prospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Poland in the East bloc.
London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe, Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary.
""Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances,"" the Times' futuristic view continued.
""West Germany withdraws from NATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes for reunification and neutrality.""
That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosens its hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.
The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other barriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many, ominous.
As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in 1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _ 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.
West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, and despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many Soviet bloc neighbors.
A unified Germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts of the Soviet bloc.
Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's boasting that he had brought about ""the unity of the German nation.""
Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the French Institute of International Relations, says she believes that ""as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward Germany.
This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.""
""Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France,"" she added.
Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from Washington and Moscow.
During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said that reunification is a ""matter for the Germans to decide.""
But he added: ""If that (reunification) was worked out between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests.""
For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a news conference in Bonn in June, saying only, ""the situation in Europe today was determined by historical realities.""
Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have been sharply divided on the issue.
""In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,"" wrote commentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent.
""The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.""
Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a ""hypothesis that cannot be excluded.""
As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country in near-record numbers.
More than 100,000 East Germans are expected to resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in the Communist nation's work force.
Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the 77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.
During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respect for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.
""Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire and water,"" Honecker added on the issue of reunification.
There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the capitalist West.
The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.
""After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,"" member of Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.
The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic Party.
""Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.
Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to disturb her sleep,"" Maier predicted in 1955.
""The lioness will one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.""
Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: ""I love Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.""","With growing numbers of disgruntled East Germans emigrating to West Germany, the idea of reunification seems possible and is being seriously discussed.
Most West German officials and President Bush support the idea.
Soviet and East German leaders oppose it, Honecker much more strongly than Gorbachev.
Throughout the rest of Europe unification scenarios are being considered and discussed by officials and media commentators.
Recalling Nazi Germany's sordid past, some express a mistrust toward uniting a Germany that could become Europe's economic powerhouse with almost 80 million people.

"America's 1988 drought captured attention everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history.
The Associated Press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and found the money spread far beyond the drought.
By SCOTT McCARTNEY, and FRED BAYLES, Associated Press Writers : 
The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more _
an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.
An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.
Payments went far beyond the initial intent to save Midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy, an effort _ supported by almost everyone _ that simply grew and grew and grew.
At each step, the program was broadened.
Congress began with a bill to aid drought victims.
The lawmakers added hail to the relief package.
Then floods.
Next came ""heat,"" an addition from the Agriculture Department.
By the time checks were being written at the county level, the AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ""ineffective herbicide.""
None of those conditions should have been ruled eligible, administrators in Washington say.
Nothing in federal procedures, however, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for routine approval or checking.
By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S. farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states.
The taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion.
""We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,"" said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the first time in 1988.
Loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major reasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining federal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act.
The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure.
""Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers,"" said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University.
""(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of agriculture.""
In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.
Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility requirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for example _
their requests for aid were approved anyway by local officials.
Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous program.
As tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what was offered, they said.
""It was there, so I took it,"" said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.
Government officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program.
Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1 billion drought relief program.
""Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true,"" said Dan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for the Agriculture Department.
""What percentage, we don't know.
But that is part of the beast I guess that was created.
Whenever you do this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.""
The AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.
Those growers profited by ""triple-dipping"": reaping crop insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting the same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal under the 1988 program.
Disaster payments in several states also went to banks, corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations designed to match benefits to small farmers.
In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief because of the bill's $2 million cutoff on gross annual income collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm.
Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of $3 billion, received a check through its energy division.
The American Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M
University and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the Jesuit order.
Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year produce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local Agriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation.
Wrong, say Washington officials _
the ceiling applies to revenue from all operations.
Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.
In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut that by 36 percent, to $706 million.
In Iowa the aid, calculated by the federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said.
Without that money, ""it would have meant substantially more losses to Main Street,"" Cochran said.
""Drought legislation saved businesses from having to close their doors.""
To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought payments were matched county by county in a computer database.
From those results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study.
Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual farms' participation in the program, were requested for about 12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act.
Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the FOIA.
One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000 acres near Levelland.
Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.
Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance.
And he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with milo _ and made a good crop.
According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly $100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.
""I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for me,"" Gresham said.
""You can't farm without the government.
You play their game.""","An investigation revealed that the record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for devastated small mid-western grain farmers, became an unexpected election-year windfall for thousands of unintended farmers.
The bill was broadened by Congress to include hail, then floods, next heat, and eventually, insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus.
Farmers in non-drought areas such as California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland, New Jersey and Massachusetts benefited.
Nevertheless, the program did provide crucial assistance where needed, particularly in hard-hit North Dakota, where an estimated $1.1 million drought loss was cut by 36 percent to $706 million.","[[169, 208], [353, 457], [481, 487], [500, 562], [907, 920], [925, 935], [944, 983], [1094, 1119], [1121, 1129], [1186, 1196], [1220, 1231], [1233, 1237], [1244, 1248], [1296, 1333], [1491, 1527], [685, 688], [704, 733], [791, 831], [2877, 2900], [2910, 2919], [2933, 2969], [2978, 3006], [3024, 3080], [3090, 3163], [5623, 5630], [5635, 5638], [5648, 5663], [5672, 5736], [5744, 5751], [5753, 5823], [5848, 5851], [5867, 5910]]"
"America's 1988 drought captured attention everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history.
The Associated Press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and found the money spread far beyond the drought.
By SCOTT McCARTNEY, and FRED BAYLES, Associated Press Writers : 
The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more _
an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.
An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.
Payments went far beyond the initial intent to save Midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy, an effort _ supported by almost everyone _ that simply grew and grew and grew.
At each step, the program was broadened.
Congress began with a bill to aid drought victims.
The lawmakers added hail to the relief package.
Then floods.
Next came ""heat,"" an addition from the Agriculture Department.
By the time checks were being written at the county level, the AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ""ineffective herbicide.""
None of those conditions should have been ruled eligible, administrators in Washington say.
Nothing in federal procedures, however, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for routine approval or checking.
By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S. farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states.
The taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion.
""We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,"" said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the first time in 1988.
Loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major reasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining federal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act.
The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure.
""Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers,"" said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University.
""(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of agriculture.""
In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.
Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility requirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for example _
their requests for aid were approved anyway by local officials.
Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous program.
As tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what was offered, they said.
""It was there, so I took it,"" said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.
Government officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program.
Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1 billion drought relief program.
""Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true,"" said Dan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for the Agriculture Department.
""What percentage, we don't know.
But that is part of the beast I guess that was created.
Whenever you do this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.""
The AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.
Those growers profited by ""triple-dipping"": reaping crop insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting the same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal under the 1988 program.
Disaster payments in several states also went to banks, corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations designed to match benefits to small farmers.
In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief because of the bill's $2 million cutoff on gross annual income collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm.
Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of $3 billion, received a check through its energy division.
The American Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M
University and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the Jesuit order.
Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year produce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local Agriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation.
Wrong, say Washington officials _
the ceiling applies to revenue from all operations.
Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.
In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut that by 36 percent, to $706 million.
In Iowa the aid, calculated by the federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said.
Without that money, ""it would have meant substantially more losses to Main Street,"" Cochran said.
""Drought legislation saved businesses from having to close their doors.""
To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought payments were matched county by county in a computer database.
From those results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study.
Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual farms' participation in the program, were requested for about 12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act.
Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the FOIA.
One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000 acres near Levelland.
Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.
Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance.
And he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with milo _ and made a good crop.
According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly $100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.
""I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for me,"" Gresham said.
""You can't farm without the government.
You play their game.""","The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988 became an unexpected election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.

"In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov as a ""man of honesty and sincerity"" who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers.
An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of the party daily Pravda.
Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and scientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a funeral commission in a black box on its front page.
Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours after urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its seven-decade strangehold on political power.
""A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honesty and sincerity has passed away,"" the obituary said.
""Everything that Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions.""
The obituary noted Sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of Gorky about 250 miles east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.
""Gross injustices were permitted in relation to A.D. Sakharov,"" it said.
It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlev and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.
However, the signatures of several other Politburo members, including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative Yegor K. Ligachev were missing.
Absence of their signatures could signify that the disagreed with part of the obituary.
Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, had said he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.
It was Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev for permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system, who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him he could return to Moscow.
The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People's Deputies that Sakharov's death was a ""great loss.""
Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachev said he respected Sakharov.
""He was not some sort of political intriguer,"" the Soviet president said Friday.
Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Monday afternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.
Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartment building Friday evening, holding candles and wreathing his photograph in flowers.
Memorial services were scheduled Sunday at the city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physics institute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, of which he was a leading member.
The popular nighttime TV program ""Vzglad"" showed a brief interview with his widow, Yelena Bonner, discussing the funeral arrangements.
The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist, which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
But it said that Sakharov realized the danger of the weapon he had helped create.
""Working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction, A.D. Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide production and testing, and stubbornly placed before the government the question of limiting such tests,"" it said.

"Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ""gamburgers,"" ""chizburgers"" and ""Filay-o-feesh"" sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time.
The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said.
The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed, lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union.
The crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours later than planned.
""I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before me,"" said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant.
""And it was only 10 rubles for all this,"" she said.
""I'm taking it back for the girls at the factory to try.""
Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.
The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency is worth on the black market.
Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto.
The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with the city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates.
The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest, company officials said.
Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan, the officials said.
Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast, friendly service.
Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard.
Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.
One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink.
For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger.
Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating ""gamburger.""
They tried them one-handed.
They picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents.
One young woman finally squashed her ""Beeg Mak"" to fit her lips around it.
""It tasted great!""
a 14-year-old boy said.
""It's a lot different from a stolovaya,"" he continued with a smile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage.
Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos.
Publicity-conscious managers had the staff shout ""Good morning, America!""
in English and Russian, for an American TV network.
McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five hours of operation.
The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in hopes of preventing burger-scalping.
McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy, meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer.
One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because ""when they went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails.
They found you need a permit to buy nails.""","Hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening of McDonald's on Moscow's Pushkin Square.
Musicians played and dancers danced.
The world's newest, largest McDonald's then proceeded to ring up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening day record for McDonald's worldwide.
Generally accustomed to clerks who snarl, Muscovites got a first-hand look at efficient, fast and friendly service.
For most customers it was their first experience with a hamburger.
Initial reactions were favorable.
This is the first of twenty McDonald's planned for the Soviet Union.
It brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates.","[[3199, 3280], [3305, 3319], [2154, 2171], [2183, 2192], [2217, 2223], [149, 159], [208, 227], [277, 376], [1897, 1929], [1953, 1990], [2323, 2364], [2516, 2582], [2516, 2582], [28, 35], [49, 68], [509, 556], [1520, 1534], [1625, 1689]]"
"Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ""gamburgers,"" ""chizburgers"" and ""Filay-o-feesh"" sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time.
The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said.
The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed, lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union.
The crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours later than planned.
""I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before me,"" said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant.
""And it was only 10 rubles for all this,"" she said.
""I'm taking it back for the girls at the factory to try.""
Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.
The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency is worth on the black market.
Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto.
The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with the city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates.
The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest, company officials said.
Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan, the officials said.
Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast, friendly service.
Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard.
Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.
One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink.
For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger.
Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating ""gamburger.""
They tried them one-handed.
They picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents.
One young woman finally squashed her ""Beeg Mak"" to fit her lips around it.
""It tasted great!""
a 14-year-old boy said.

"Moslem militants armed with automatic rifles shot and killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on Thursday in Srinagar, the flashpoint of a violent separatist campaign, officials said.
Witnesses said a cigarette vendor also was killed in the attack, which occurred outside the vendor's kiosk in the Chanpora suburb of the city.
A bystander was injured, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The deaths brought to 81 the number of people killed since Jan. 20 in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants fighting for secession of the Moslem-dominated Kashmir region from Hindu-majority India.
Most victims have been protesters shot while defying a curfew imposed Jan. 20 when government forces launched a crackdown.
A senior police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said militants exploded bombs in a government building and a government-run bank in Srinagar's outskirts Thursday, causing severe damage.
There were no casualties.
The official also blamed militants for a fire that broke out in a downtown shopping center.
No casualties were reported in the blaze.
Security was strengthened across Srinagar after the incidents.
New roadblocks were set up and more paramilitary troops were deployed on the streets, the official said.
Some soldiers patrolled in trucks while others perched with machine guns on the sides of roads.
A curfew that was to have begun at 6 p.m. instead took effect in the afternoon in three areas of the city after the shootings.
The two paramilitary Border Security Force officers were shot with Chinese-designed AK-47 rifles from close range as they walked from their camp toward the cigarette kiosk, 100 yards from the camp's gate, said Ashok Patel, inspector-general of the Border Security Force.
He said the men were unarmed and were not in uniform when attacked.
It was the first reported slaying by Moslem militants of paramilitary troops.
The Border Security Force, known to be a more disciplined and tougher force that the state constabulary, is normally deployed on international borders but has been increasingly used to put down the Kashmir secessionist movement.
State police began preparations to counter violence Friday, the Moslem sabbath.
On past sabbath days, speeches have been broadcast from mosques urging people to fight for Kashmir's independence.
Gov. Jagmohan, known to be a tough administrator who ordered the Jan. 20 crackdown, on Thursday appealed for peace in Kashmir, the Himalayan valley once popular for its gardens, lakes and apple orchards.
""Let us impress once again on our young brothers to see the futility of the cult of guns and understand the magnitude of all-round misery that it has caused,"" he said in a letter released by the state government.
Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses only one name, wrote the letter to the father of a Moslem youth who was killed in a bomb explosion in a shopping complex on Wednesday.
Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned on gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir state, India's only predominantly Moslem state.
Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems, but nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's population of 880 million.

"Drugs are now available that can put AIDS patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a vaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of AIDS experts said Saturday.
At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said.
""We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing remission,"" said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
""I think there is evidence that a substantial number of people who would have died are now alive,"" Haseltine said at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDS epidemic may be coming to an end.
A number of treatments for AIDS and AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many of them are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
""It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliver and require monitoring,"" Haseltine said.
""Unless we develop a vaccine, the future of this epidemic worldwide will be extremely grim,"" he said.
A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful, said James Mullins of Stanford University.
But that has changed.
""There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,"" Mullins said.
Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses have shown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believe that similar vaccines can be found for humans.
""There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,"" said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that an epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the inner cities.
In New York City, for example, tuberculosis declined between 1960 and 1977, but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 level again.
""We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of progress in our tuberculosis control efforts,"" said Vermund.
And unlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casual contact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air.
""I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the general population,"" Vermund said.
Many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract AIDS.
They lose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria, which normally would have remained dormant, and tuberculosis appears.
""It's likely to be yet another health problem imposed on the inner cities, where the health problems are already legion,"" Vermund said.
There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS, but that is likely, Vermund said.
He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic, probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the 1970s.
Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis, Vermund said.","At a time when there is some hope for the control of the AIDS epidemic, we are seeing a large increase in the incidence of tuberculosis.
In New York City tuberculosis declined from 1960 to 1977, but by 1990, it has increased to the 1960 level.
Many of the new cases occurred when individuals who had AIDS and lost the ability to suppress the latent tuberculosis that they might have carried for years.

"An experimental cancer drug that works after a single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study.
The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated, and none has relapsed so far.
Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it ""may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia.""
The drug also has been used successfully against chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
It, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies.
The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif.
Scripps recently made an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals to produce and distribute the drug once it's approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as far back as four years ago.
In 11, the disease disappeared and they remain disease free.
In all, the Scripps doctors have treated 24 patients with almost complete success.
However, they caution that longer follow up will be necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured the disease.
Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed in recent years.
They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug that is similar to 2-CdA.
However, interferon is less effective, and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of fever.
Patients experienced no nausea, hair loss, rashes or other symptoms typical of cancer therapy.
Also unlike other treatments, this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.","A new drug called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated.

"The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives.
The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare.
The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988.
At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the country's internal affairs.
The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan envoys in Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann.
Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua but said he was not interested.
He told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally by President Bush.
When Bush telephoned him earlier this week, Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President Reagan.
The U.S. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay Wells' nomination.
When Wells was nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late 1986, Helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11 months.
They took the action as a means of expressing opposition to the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist government.","The Bush administration fearing that the nomination of Melissa Wells to be ambassador to Nicaragua might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight has decided to name Harry Shlaudeman for the post.

"The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives.
The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare.
The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988.
At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the country's internal affairs.

"U.S. tour operators are planning to send a record 4,000 or more travelers to Antarctica, prompting calls for strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife and the very fate of the frozen continent.
""The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than tripled in the past five years,"" said Bruce Manheim, a Washington activist of the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing controls inadequate.
Antarctica has become a ""hot"" travel destination for the 1990s, beckoning older Americans seeking more adventure than Europe and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a privileged few in their youth.
They are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry, an estimated $1.3 billion-a-year phenomenon.
About 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988, 3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the December-February summer season.
Manheim says it could reach 5,000.
""There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary visits to remote places in the world,"" said Manheim.
He filed an appeal Tuesday with the government urging more regulation.
""We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be regulated carefully,"" he said.
Concern began mounting after the January 1989 grounding of the Argentine naval ship Bahia Paraiso in which an estimated 175,000 gallons leaked into marine habitats, killing seals, penguins and other marine life.
The vessel remains at the site off Palmer Station with some oil in its tanks.
Particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of Ocean Cruise Lines of Fort Lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years to Antarctica, the 460-passenger Ocean Princess.
Rates begin at $3,895 per person for a double-occupancy cabin on its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly.
The first round trip from Buenos Aires, Argentina, begins Dec. 22.
Manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of cruise ship visits to breeding grounds.
He said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and other birds.
""A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar catastrophes,"" said Manheim.
The U.S. government responds that effective regulations are already in place.
""We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with the explosion of Antarctica tourism,"" said Jack Talmadge of the National Science Foundation, which regulates U.S. activities in Antarctica.
Talmadge said the NSF has issued tourist regulations, established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and taken steps to limit visits to U.S. research stations.
He said the tour operators are also cooperating with the NSF to minimize the impact of tourism, including giving advance notice of ship visits.
Although 16 nations fly flags in Antactica and seven claim slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is larger than the United States and Mexico combined.
Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first tourists visited in 1958.
Now, the Chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its Teniente Marsh Station on King George island, and LanChile airlines began commercial flights to that Antarctic stop last year.
Australian entrepreneurs have proposed a five-story hotel, airstrip and hovercraft dock.
The Canada-based Adventure Network currently flies tourists to one South Pole station.
But the bulk of the tourists are Americans brought in by U.S.-based operators.
Conservationists say the United States should therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy.
""Antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the United States, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international level,"" said Manheim.
Operators of the Ocean Cruise Lines said there is no cause for alarm.
""The tourist visiting Antarctica is a determined environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and I can assure you that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal,"" said Lars Eric Lindblad, an Antarctic travel pioneer who will lecture aboard the Ocean Princess.
James Barnes, with Friends of the Earth in Washington, concludes that the travelers may leave their footprints, but they often return home more committed environmentalists _
""Ambassadors of Antarctica.""
Nonetheless, he said, ""The scale of these activities is growing at such a pace that it does provide cause for concern.""","""The number of tourist visiting Antarctica has more than tripled in the past five years,"" said Bruce Manheim, a Washington activist with the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing controls to protect Antarctic wildlife inadequate.
Manheim's appeal seeks strict controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on tourist observation of wildlife, and coordination of cruise ship visits to breeding grounds.
Because most tourists to Antarctica are Americans, conservations believe the U.S. should take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy.
The U.S. government responds that effective regulations are already in place.

"A major earthquake rumbled through the jungles of southern Sudan on Sunday near the war-torn region's largest city, but officials said there appeared to be no casualties and little damage.
The quake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
A temblor of that size is capable of causing widespread destruction.
The official Sudan News Agency said the earthquake caused no deaths or injuries.
But much of the area affected by the quake is so isolated that any news might take days or weeks.
Juba, southern Sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of the quake's reported epicenter.
The region has been hit by famine as well as fighting between the government and the rebel People's Liberation Army, and Juba is crammed with refugees from the 7-year-old civil war.
In Nairobi, Kenya, Bob Koepp, a Lutheran World Federation official, said a pilot flying relief supplies to Juba returned late Sunday and said the city had not been seriously affected.
He said there was some ""negligible"" damage.
""It wasn't very heavy at Juba.
The epicenter apparently was in the swamps and the ground may have just soaked it up,"" Koepp said.
Scientists said the quake's epicenter was 700 miles south of Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
It occurred in sparsely populated territory controlled by the rebels, who hold most of the southern countryside.
Relief workers in two rebel-controlled villages, Bor and Torit, apparently told officials in Nairobi, Kenya, the earthquake caused no damage there.
""It's pretty low area over there, with low buildings and quite remote,"" Koepp said.
A crew with Koepp's organization landed in the region with relief supplies two hours after the quake struck at 4:22 a.m. and reported seeing nothing amiss.
Late Sunday, a Khartoum airport tower operator said flights to the southern city had not been disrupted.
Pierre-Andre Conod of the International Committee of the Red Cross said he had no details about injuries or damage.
He said colleagues in Juba had not made their regular radio contact with Khartoum but cautioned that ""maybe they have a problem with the antenna.
We cannot say it is due to the earthquake.""
People seeking haven from the war and from famine have more than doubled Juba's population of 125,000.
In recent years, hundreds of thousands have died in southern Sudan, an area the size of Texas.
Egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including one at the Aswan High Dam, 600 miles south of Cairo and just north of the Sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the Richter scale.
The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. reported an identical reading.
""It's such a big quake that the monitoring stations are saturated with data,"" said geologist Rashad M. Kebeasy, president of Egypt's National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics.
""This is an extremely dangerous earthquake.
It is the first time that such a quake has struck this area.""
He said ""large and very dangerous aftershocks"" were to be expected for the next two days.
The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Every increase of one number, say from magnitude 5.5 to magnitude 6.6, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
A magnitude of 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage.
Magnitude 8 is a great earthquake capable of tremendous damage.
Last October's earthquake near San Francisco registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
Kebeasy, an expert on earthquakes of northeastern Africa, said the epicenter was just west of the Great African Rift.
That earthquake zone stretches 4,000 miles from Mozambique through the Red Sea to Lebanon.
The proximity to the rift accounts for the quake's magnitude, Kebeasy said.","A major earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter Scale hit Southern Sudan on Sunday.
A quake of that magnitude is capable of causing widespread destruction.
The quake's epicenter was in an isolated swampland 700 miles from Khartoum, and little damage has been reported.
Flights were going in and out of Juba, the nearest large city.
The epicenter was a little west of the Great African Rift, an earthquake line that runs from Mozambique through the Red Sea to Lebanon, but it was the first dangerous earthquake to be reported in that area.","[[0, 34], [50, 74], [189, 232], [234, 301], [1132, 1176], [1194, 1202], [396, 429], [433, 441], [1017, 1059], [120, 155], [174, 187], [3521, 3574], [3552, 3596], [3619, 3665], [2785, 2888]]"
"Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin triumphed over opposition from Mikhail S. Gorbachev to win the presidency of the largest Soviet republic today in what he called ""Russia's social, economic and spiritual rebirth.""
After three hard-fought ballots in the 1,060-member Russian Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin won 535, four more than the majority he needed.
Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov, received 467 ballots.
Yeltsin now poses a substantial challenge to Gorbachev, who retains the two most powerful jobs in the country: president of the Soviet Union and general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
However, Gennadi Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said Yeltsin's election could strengthen Gorbachev's campaign for economic reforms.
""Yeltsin's victory is an expression of general discontent with how things are going in the Soviet Union's biggest republic,"" Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.
""The Soviet Union is a democracy, so we accept what the Russian parliament has decided.
It may be a blessing in disguise.
President Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right, and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the left,"" he said.
Igor Malashenko, foreign policy advisor to the Communist Party who accompanied Gerasimov at the news conference, agreed.
""This victory of Yeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem for Gorbachev,"" Malashenko said.
""Yeltsin is also a reformer, although he reflects concepts which are different from Gorbachev.""
""In this respect I believe it (the election) can strengthen the cause of reform in the Soviet Union.
Today, many people blame Gorbachev for problems and now they have another person to blame.""
After the election result was announced in the Grand Kremlin Palace, the burly 59-year-old Yeltsin, strode to the podium, received warm applause and cheers from fellow lawmakers, and was handed a bouquet of flowers.
Yeltsin said he felt ""a certain satisfaction, but at the same time, I have much more a feeling of responsibility at this turning point for Russia and the country.""
""I pledge not to spare anything _ health or time _ to do everything to get out of this crisis and lead Russia to better times,"" Yeltsin said in his victory speech.
He called the day ""the beginning of the road to Russia's social, economic and spiritual rebirth, the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of Russia as a sovereign, independent government in the framework of our union.""
Gorbachev actively opposed Yeltsin's election, telling the Russian Congress last week that his platform of moving political and economic power from central to local authorities would lead to a ""breakup of the union.""
The Russian Federation is by far the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, stretching from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east.
It is home to one-half the country's 285 million people and includes Moscow.
As the president of Russia, Yeltsin will have a highly visible platform from which to wage his campaign for more radical reforms than those pursued so far by Gorbachev.
The victory marks an amazing comeback for Yeltsin.
Less than three years ago, he was reviled in the Soviet press, attacked by party officials, rebuffed by his former mentor, Gorbachev, and considered finished politically.
Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist Party, but he was fired in 1987 after showing little reverance for party hierarchy.
Yeltsin, however, made his rift with Gorbachev work for him.
The popular and outspoken Yeltsin had lost the second round of voting on Saturday by just 28 votes.
He lost the first round Friday with 497 ballots to 473 for Krasnodar regional Communist Party chief Ivan Polozkov.
He was nominated again Monday and faced Vlasov, who had Gorbachev's support, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East, who received 11 votes.
After his election, Yeltsin walked through the Kremlin grounds with reporters and well-wishers.
After passing through the Spassky Gate, he was joined by more supporters.
""Thank you!
Thank you for our future!""
one man shouted.
Yeltsin mounted the steps of an embankment below the Kremlin wall for an impromptu speech to supporters who rushed across the cobblestone street.
To shouts of ""victory!""
Yeltsin pledged to work for a ""renewed Russia.""
The crowd pledged support.
""We're prepared to go together with him into tough times.
Everyone says that,"" one crowd member, Nadezda Matveyeva said.
During his campaign, Yeltsin called on the Congress to reject the Kremlin's new program for gradually transforming the country's crippled, centrally planned economy to a partial market economy.
""The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its defense,"" he said.
The reform program, which would triple the price of bread on July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1, caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar sales to non-residents of the capital.
Gorbachev, who left Moscow today for a Washington summit, went on national television Sunday night to try to calm fears.
But anxiety is high and the list of items being rationed is on the rise.
Yeltsin has broadly outlined a plan that would more rapidly seek a transition to a market-based economy, giving more freedom to enterprises and entrepreneurs.
Lawmakers said Monday they believed Yeltsin's offer of a coalition government in the republic bolstered his chances to win today's round.
Discontent over the government's economic program also boosted Yeltsin's campaign, said one of his backers, lawmaker Leonid Gurevich of Murmansk.
Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people could lose their jobs as a result of the central government's reforms, expected to drive many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy.
Under the three-step reform plan, to be implemented through 1995, 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public sector, and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices.","Radical reformer Boris N.

"Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton secured a solid majority to win his sixth straight Democratic nomination.
But, like a boxing champion who slipped by on points, he is being asked to explain the lack of a knockout punch.
Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when first elected in 1978 and he has had a stranglehold on the state's Democratic Party ever since.
But in last week's primary, he garnered just 55 percent of the vote while Tom McRae, an unpolished campaigner who heads a public policy think tank, earned 39 percent.
Four also-rans divided the rest.
Clinton, who toyed with the idea of running for the presidency in 1988 and already is talking about 1996, said he saw no cause for concern in the margin of his primary victory.
""I didn't see how I could get 60 percent, knowing the number of people who were saying in the surveys that they thought I was a good governor but were concerned about the tenure issue,"" Clinton said recently.
Tenure was summed up repeatedly by McRae as ""10 years is long enough.""
Arkansans grow bored with their politicians sooner than voters elsewhere, Clinton said, in part because politics in the state is so personal.
Pumping hands at shopping malls and crawfish festivals is considered as important as running the right television ad.
""I'm just trying to tell people that in business they wouldn't fire a 43-year-old with 10 years of experience who's doing a good job,"" Clinton said days before the primary.
Sheffield Nelson, who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, already is jumping on the theme, saying ""Arkansas is ready for a change.""
Clinton, who has focused on improving the state's education system, counters by calling himself the candidate of change.
""Frankly, if you look at what I proposed, compared with the others, it represents more change,"" he said.
""Ten years is an asset, not a liability.""
Clinton lost his first re-election bid in 1980 to Republican Frank White, but won again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when the gubernatorial term was changed to four years.
He has all but promised not to run for the White House in 1992 if re-elected this year.
His showing in this year's primary, largely in line with pre-election polls, was the first time since his political comeback in 1982 that Clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote.
""I'm sure the governor would like to have made a better showing, but when you're in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a lot of enemies,"" said Bill Paschall, a Little Rock political consultant.
""I don't think it's a death blow that he made 55 (percent), but it shows him he has to work harder.""
While the biggest complaint against Clinton appears to be that he has been in office too long, the governor also has been accused of being more interested in his national ambitions than state concerns.
Clinton's recent troubles with the legislature also have been a sticking point.
Twice in 1989 he failed to win legislative approval for proposals to increase taxes.
Nelson, who hopes to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat, said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes.
""I'd say against an unknown who never held an office, I think that was low.
It probably did make some bells go off in his head,"" Nelson said.
Clinton said he would have done better if a large number of traditional Democrats hadn't crossed over to the GOP primary to vote against Robinson.
""We did poorly in areas where I did not campaign; where my supporters, in spite of my best interest, believed the polls and didn't work; and where we did a poor job of telling the people what I had done that affected their lives; and where people knew there was an alternative but didn't know much about what the alternative was,"" Clinton said.
Betsey Wright, Clinton's former chief of staff, said the governor's supporters were complacent.
""Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people find it difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight energies,"" she said of the primary.","Governor Bill Clinton won his sixth straight primary election by 55%, a drop from previous years.
He has no cause for concern jokingly citing the ""tenure"" issue, meaning, ""ten years is long enough,"" used by his opponent.
He counters, ""a business wouldn't fire a 43-year old with ten years of experience who's doing a good job.""
Clinton has focused on improving Arkansas' educational system and calls himself the candidate of change.
He was elected first in 1978 but lost in 1980.
He won again in '82, '84, and '86, when the term was increased to four years.
He has implied that if he is elected this year, he will not run for president in 1992.","[[14, 36], [43, 77], [253, 261], [367, 369], [382, 389], [391, 402], [408, 430], [674, 701], [949, 969], [981, 1017], [1320, 1412], [1415, 1427], [1587, 1595], [1620, 1686], [1700, 1739], [267, 288], [1896, 1900], [1927, 1934], [1966, 2008], [2023, 2053], [2055, 2141]]"
"The republic of Slovenia plans to begin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty within a new Yugoslav confederation, the state Tanjug news agency reported Monday.
Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction of Yugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the most politically liberal and prosperous of the country's six member republics.
Slovenia ""should be set up as a sovereign state, with all attributes of factual authority and with full international-legal rights,"" Tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the Slovenian presidency, the top local ruling body.
The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the new constitution will be the ""constitution of the sovereign state of Slovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics),"" Tanjug said.
The proposal is to be discussed by Slovenia's parliament in mid-July, Kucan said.
Its approval is viewed as almost certain.
Slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and the media in Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, and particularly in the country's largest republic of Serbia, of harboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interests at the expense of federal goals.
Slovenian authorities claim Serbia is trying to politically and economically dominate the Yugoslav federation by introducing greater federal control and by limiting the autonomy of the republics.
More than 70 percent of the residents of the northern republic believe their region might be better off if it were outside the Yugoslav federation, results of a public opinion poll said last March.
Only 15 percent of the Slovenes surveyed expressed their wish for Slovenia to remain a republic within Yugoslavia in the present form.

Slovenia's parliament almost certainly will approve the plan.
Serbian politicians have frequently accused Slovenia of harboring separatist tendencies and protecting its own interests at the expense of federal goals.
Slovenia says Serbia is trying to politically and economically dominate the Yugoslav federation by introducing greater federal control.
In a poll last March, 70% of Slovenia's 2 million inhabitants thought the region would be better off outside the Yugoslav federation.
Slovenia and Croatia both held free elections this year.","[[48, 97], [605, 673], [98, 133], [466, 506], [864, 920], [946, 986], [988, 1039], [1170, 1204], [1205, 1272], [1274, 1422], [181, 218], [1480, 1514], [1618, 1666], [1533, 1616], [1803, 1828], [1862, 1891]]"
"The republic of Slovenia plans to begin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty within a new Yugoslav confederation, the state Tanjug news agency reported Monday.
Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction of Yugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the most politically liberal and prosperous of the country's six member republics.
Slovenia ""should be set up as a sovereign state, with all attributes of factual authority and with full international-legal rights,"" Tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the Slovenian presidency, the top local ruling body.
The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the new constitution will be the ""constitution of the sovereign state of Slovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics),"" Tanjug said.
The proposal is to be discussed by Slovenia's parliament in mid-July, Kucan said.
Its approval is viewed as almost certain.
Slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and the media in Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, and particularly in the country's largest republic of Serbia, of harboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interests at the expense of federal goals.
Slovenian authorities claim Serbia is trying to politically and economically dominate the Yugoslav federation by introducing greater federal control and by limiting the autonomy of the republics.
More than 70 percent of the residents of the northern republic believe their region might be better off if it were outside the Yugoslav federation, results of a public opinion poll said last March.
Only 15 percent of the Slovenes surveyed expressed their wish for Slovenia to remain a republic within Yugoslavia in the present form.
Both Slovenia and Croatia, the two Yugoslav republics that held free elections this year, have proclaimed a readiness to turn the Yugoslav federation of six republics and two provinces into a looser confederation of states cooperating voluntarily.
Also Monday, Serbia's president Slobodan Milosevic, in a speech to the Serbian parliament, said the new constitution Serbia is preparing is designed to ""offset the transformation of federal Yugoslavia into a confederation.""","Small, liberal Slovenia plans to work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty within a Yugoslav confederation.
The proposal is to be discussed by their parliament in mid-July, according to President Milan Kucan.
Its approval is nearly certain.
A majority of Slovenes favor independence, according to a poll.
Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, particularly Serbia, has accused Slovenia of separatist tendencies, which they oppose; Slovenia, on the other hand, claims Serbia favors more federal controls and tries to dominate the Yugoslav federation.
Croatia has joined Slovenia in its desire for a looser confederation of Yugoslav states.

"Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.
Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the ""Chunnel"" - the Channel Tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues.
""It is an example of what Europe is about,"" British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in London.
""This is Europe in practice.""
The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802, who thought he could defeat the English by connecting Britain to Europe with a land passage.
The Chunnel is scheduled for completion in June 1993.
""This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island,"" said a construction union official.
Eight workers suffered injuries, two seriously, about 90 minutes later when a tractor towing supplies rolled over on them in a service gallery, authorities in nearby Sangatte reported.
The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
That time is comparable to flying, if transport to and from airports is included, and is half the time of a car-ferry journey.
The conservative Daily Express newspaper noted in its Wednesday editions that Britons would theoretically be able to walk to France for the first time since the last Ice Age.
The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion for unforeseen cost overruns.
The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the English Channel marks a major turning point in three years of drilling on the world's costliest tunnel.
The meeting point was just over 13{ miles southeast of Shakespeare Cliff, the British terminus near the town of Dover, and 10 miles northwest of the French town of Sangatte, near Calais.
The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles.
Geological conditions account for the different progress on each side.
French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their British counterparts and relayed the news to TransManche officials.
The first champagne corks popped minutes later.
""It's an exciting moment.
It's the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels,"" said Gordon Crighton, tunnel engineering manager.
""We see it as just another exercise, but I'm sure there will be a lot of parties going on,"" he said.
Preliminary tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of alignment.
Another day will be needed to be certain, technicians said, but they called the line-up ""exceptional,"" considering the massive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories high.
The workers will now bore out a one-yard hole to permit passage from one half to the other.
They are expected to greet each other with handshakes in a few weeks.
Two Japanese-designed boring machines are drilling the tunnel.
After it is finished, one will be dismantled and hauled out in pieces.
The other will drill its own grave and be buried in cement because French officials said it will be too costly to extricate it.
A work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding more pay on the French side appeared likely Monday to stall the linkup until the weekend or beyond.
But TransManche officials said earlier Tuesday that the meeting in the middle would occur on schedule.
The Chunnel actually consists of three tunnels - two for railway trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them.
Taking into account all the tunnels, 80 percent of the drilling has been completed by giant, Japanese-built boring machines working from Calais and Folkstone, England.
Tuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the French as a ""mouse ole"" - a bore only two inches in diameter.
President Francois Mitterrand and Mrs. Thatcher are expected to meet each other in the tunnel Jan. 26, after the digging for much of the tunnel is finished.
The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.
Eurotunnel PLC, the world's largest engineering project, announced Oct. 8 that it had reached an agreement with its banks on $3.5 billion in new credit.
More than 200 banks are involved in the financing.
The Chunnel's scheduled debut in mid-1993 would come six months after the 12-nation European Community formally drops remaining trade barriers, becoming a unified marketplace of 320 million consumers.
Officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in the first year of operation, although Eurotunnel doesn't expect a profit until the end of the century.
A study released last Friday in Paris by transportation experts said the tunnel's completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of continental Europe.
Some Britons have worries of a different sort, fearing an influx of ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.
Since construction began in late 1987, there have been seven deaths on the British side and two on the French.
Five British firms were ordered last Wednesday to stand trial on charges related to the death of a construction worker last year.
The undersea bond between the two hereditary enemies was envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a French engineer called Albert Mathieu.
Napoleon wanted to build it, but Britain warned him off.
Tunneling actually started in subsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974, but were abandoned.","After drilling and digging since 1987 from their respective ends of the ""chunnel"", the British and French were able to talk directly through a small hole created when British workers sent a probe through the barrier separating them from their French counterparts It was a tiny hole, but it marked the end of Britain's island status.
The breakthrough came in the service tunnel.
That tunnel should be finished in January.
The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is expected in mid-1991.

More than 200 banks are involved in the financing.
The Chunnel's scheduled debut in mid-1993 would come six months after the 12-nation European Community formally drops remaining trade barriers, becoming a unified marketplace of 320 million consumers.
Officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in the first year of operation, although Eurotunnel doesn't expect a profit until the end of the century.
A study released last Friday in Paris by transportation experts said the tunnel's completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of continental Europe.
Some Britons have worries of a different sort, fearing an influx of ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.
Since construction began in late 1987, there have been seven deaths on the British side and two on the French.
Five British firms were ordered last Wednesday to stand trial on charges related to the death of a construction worker last year.
The undersea bond between the two hereditary enemies was envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a French engineer called Albert Mathieu.
Napoleon wanted to build it, but Britain warned him off.
Tunneling actually started in subsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974, but were abandoned.","As of 30 October 1990, Britain and France have been linked via a two-inch probe beneath the English Channel.
It completes a dream by Napolean who wanted to use such a tunnel to defeat Britain.
The goal is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris via rail in three hours.
The cost, with considerable overruns, is 16.7 billion dollars.
The so-called ""Chunnel"" links Shakespeare Cliff near Dover, to Sangatte, near Calais, France.
The tunnel will open in 1993 and is expected to carry 28 million passengers in the first year of operation.
There will be no profit until 2000.","[[0, 58], [83, 119], [548, 587], [597, 624], [651, 658], [1066, 1172], [1179, 1190], [1494, 1502], [1518, 1528], [1570, 1597], [1636, 1649], [264, 293], [1875, 1892], [1915, 1937], [1939, 1942], [1965, 1992], [1994, 2005], [264, 293], [1875, 1892], [1915, 1942], [1965, 1992], [1994, 2005], [690, 729], [738, 742], [4382, 4423], [4602, 4675], [4697, 4749]]"
"Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.
Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the ""Chunnel"" - the Channel Tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues.
""It is an example of what Europe is about,"" British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in London.
""This is Europe in practice.""
The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802, who thought he could defeat the English by connecting Britain to Europe with a land passage.
The Chunnel is scheduled for completion in June 1993.
""This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island,"" said a construction union official.
Eight workers suffered injuries, two seriously, about 90 minutes later when a tractor towing supplies rolled over on them in a service gallery, authorities in nearby Sangatte reported.
The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
That time is comparable to flying, if transport to and from airports is included, and is half the time of a car-ferry journey.
The conservative Daily Express newspaper noted in its Wednesday editions that Britons would theoretically be able to walk to France for the first time since the last Ice Age.
The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion for unforeseen cost overruns.
The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the English Channel marks a major turning point in three years of drilling on the world's costliest tunnel.
The meeting point was just over 13{ miles southeast of Shakespeare Cliff, the British terminus near the town of Dover, and 10 miles northwest of the French town of Sangatte, near Calais.
The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles.
Geological conditions account for the different progress on each side.
French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their British counterparts and relayed the news to TransManche officials.
The first champagne corks popped minutes later.
""It's an exciting moment.
It's the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels,"" said Gordon Crighton, tunnel engineering manager.
""We see it as just another exercise, but I'm sure there will be a lot of parties going on,"" he said.
Preliminary tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of alignment.
Another day will be needed to be certain, technicians said, but they called the line-up ""exceptional,"" considering the massive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories high.
The workers will now bore out a one-yard hole to permit passage from one half to the other.
They are expected to greet each other with handshakes in a few weeks.
Two Japanese-designed boring machines are drilling the tunnel.
After it is finished, one will be dismantled and hauled out in pieces.
The other will drill its own grave and be buried in cement because French officials said it will be too costly to extricate it.
A work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding more pay on the French side appeared likely Monday to stall the linkup until the weekend or beyond.
But TransManche officials said earlier Tuesday that the meeting in the middle would occur on schedule.
The Chunnel actually consists of three tunnels - two for railway trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them.
Taking into account all the tunnels, 80 percent of the drilling has been completed by giant, Japanese-built boring machines working from Calais and Folkstone, England.
Tuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the French as a ""mouse ole"" - a bore only two inches in diameter.
President Francois Mitterrand and Mrs. Thatcher are expected to meet each other in the tunnel Jan. 26, after the digging for much of the tunnel is finished.

"DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have been obtained by the Financial Times.
Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.
This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family.
The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss Trust.
The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price.
The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts.
If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of MCC.
The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.
Goldman's lawyers are convinced that it acted properly.
Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family.
He said MCC share purchases had been 'going on for some time' through Yakosa.
He denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's 'own account'.
He said the shares were bought for other 'foundations' and then 'held for a certain time.'
He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said.
Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell.
The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex.
On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company.
The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'.
Two other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m shares.
The Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme).
Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total.
At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds.
As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell described as 'nominee' for the two pension funds.
In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT.
In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in its account at Barclays.
Goldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account.

"US INSURERS expect to pay out an estimated Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in Florida as a result of Hurricane Andrew - by far the costliest disaster the industry has ever faced.
The figure is the first official tally of the damage resulting from the hurricane, which ripped through southern Florida last week.
In the battered region it is estimated that 275,000 people still have no electricity and at least 150,000 are either homeless or are living amid ruins.
President George Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region since the hurricane hit.
He pledged the government would see through the clean-up 'until the job is done'.
Although there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level of insurance claims, yesterday's figure comes from the Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Services Group, the property-casualty insurers' trade association.
It follows an extensive survey of the area by the big insurance companies.
Mr Gary Kerney, director of catastrophe services at the PCS, said the industry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone.
It is reckoned the bulk of the damage - over Dollars 6bn in insured claims - is in Dade County, a rural region to the south of Miami.
However, the final cost of Hurricane Andrew will be higher still.
Yesterday's estimate does not include any projection for claims in Louisiana, which was also affected by the storm, although less severely than Florida.
An estimate of the insured losses in this second state will be released later this week.
But on the Florida losses alone, Hurricane Andrew becomes the most costly insured catastrophe in the US.
Hurricane Hugo, which hit the east coast in September 1989, cost the insurance industry about Dollars 4.2bn.
The Oakland fire disaster, in California last year, cost Dollars 1.2bn.
By contrast, insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlier this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled just Dollars 775m. Hurricane Andrew leaves the US property-casualty insurers facing their worst-ever year for catastrophe losses.
The LA riots and a series of tornadoes, wind and hailstorms in states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Iowa had already produced insured losses of Dollars 3.9bn.
With Florida's Hurricane Andrew losses added in, the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn.
This easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in 1989, when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California.

Mr Ruiz Massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a federal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), and Mr Abraham Rubio Canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the Gulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas.
The two allegedly hired the gunman, and other accomplices, according to testimony from one man who has confessed to his role in the killing.
This alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man with links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by Mr Zedillo to reform his party and the country's criminal justice system will be met with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes.
According to testimony from the alleged accomplices to the assassination, the conspirators drew up a list of reform-minded politicians with plans to kill all of them.
Since Mr Ruiz Massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculation that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's reform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged to indicate this is the case.
Mr Carlos Fuentes, the novelist, asked yesterday in a newspaper article entitled 'Who is next?' whether Mexico, like Colombia, was facing a period of sustained political violence orchestrated by drug barons.
Other columnists have insinuated that more groups than currently revealed might be involved in Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder.
Mr Munoz Rocha has promised to hand himself in if his safety is guaranteed, according to a statement by Mexico's Congress.
Two newspapers reported yesterday that Mr Munoz Rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put the responsibility on Mr Rubio Canales, who reportedly blames Mr Ruiz Massieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he is currently serving.
Mr Munoz Rocha said he participated in the assassination 'because I was angry that I had not been supported in my political aspirations'.
The ruling party has denied that the crime reflects an internal battle between ideological factions in the PRI.
Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the president of the party, declared on Monday that Mr Munoz Rocha 'never had intellectual interests, never raised issues of political theory, and was never associated with making ideological pronouncements.'
Mr Pichardo insisted that the reform of the PRI would go ahead.
As if to underline this pledge, Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the head of the PRI group in the Chamber of Deputies and a reformist, was appointed to replace Mr Ruiz Massieu as the party's secretary-general.
Government officials have suggested the Gulf drug cartel may have deliberately involved Mr Munoz Rocha in the assassination to maximise the political impact of the crime.
The motives of drug traffickers are uncertain.
One view is they believed the assassination would weaken Mr Ruiz Massieu's brother, Mario, who is the deputy attorney general in charge of drug enforcement.
If this was the motivation, the plan may have backfired.
Mr Ruiz Massieu has taken charge of the investigation into his brother's death, and search for drug cartel members appears to have intensified.
Another view is the cartel was seeking revenge.

" A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.
They press fingers under their noses.
They dig their knuckles into protesters' necks, and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists.
At one point, two officers twist a woman's arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony.
In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.
His arm, contorted behind his back, finally snaps.
 The law enforcement name for these techniques is ""pain-compliance.""
Police departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate.
But opponents call the term a euphemism for torture.
 Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago.
This time, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.
 As a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy.
Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of ""police state"" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals.
 In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as ""something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America.""
 Other conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on Nov. 15, with little media attention, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force.
Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.
 Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than $50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them.
 ""I think it's utter stupidity,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said.
""Utter, complete stupidity.""
In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used ""in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . .
all through the '60s, all through the '70s,"" Gates said.
He smiled.
""You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?""
While Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about ""chokeholds"" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that ""come-along"" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.
 His officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in the country.
On a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.
 Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: ""Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.""
 Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether ""reasonable force"" included opening fire with her handgun.
 Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt.
Fred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force.
The least forceful tactic is a simple request -- ""Would you do this?""
Pain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.
 Among the most simple ""come-along"" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said.
Another trick of the trade: the ""mastoid lift,"" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck.
Demonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.
 But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and ""go limp"" when asked to move, others link arms.
They become ""human worm-balls"" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say.
Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.
 So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a ""police control device"" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.
 To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a ""trap-and-wrap"" maneuver.
The gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.
 Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.
Protesters are given every chance to move on their own.
Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.
Then ""they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain.
It's a pain control technique,"" he said.
""It's going to hurt.
That's what pain-compliance means.""
 But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage.
As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.
 Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.
 ""The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,"" Nichols said.
""With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark.
It's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking.
You say, something's wrong here.""
In the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt.
Patrick E. McKinley of LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against everything from apartheid to animal rights.
Operation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.
 ""Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion,"" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.
 Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue spokeswoman called ""100% incorrect.""
 In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley.
""I'm no doctor.
But pain has a purpose.
It's telling you to stop doing what you're doing.
If you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible.""
In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta.
As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality increased: 
 * In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: ""Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.""
 * In Pittsburgh, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers.
 * In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with ""crotch carries"" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs.
A priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting pain: ""The demonic element entered in here.""
 A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: ""By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . .
'
Jesus!
Jesus!'
""
In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of ""curbside justice.""
 Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed by kindred spirits.
 ""It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent,"" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration.
""Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life.
I've never been roughed up like that before.
Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.""
 Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police.
Rather, leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
A group called Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed ""real atrocities"" by the LAPD.
But others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint.
For example, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply.
 ""I can't have much sympathy for them,"" she said of the anti-abortion ""rescuers,"" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice ""clinic defenders"" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton.
""The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous.
What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.""
At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: ""L.A. blue, we're with you.""
 Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found support.
""I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the Christians to the lions,"" he said.
In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.
 Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' fight to restrain what he calls ""the torture police.""
He also has charged that his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex issue.
 William B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, has similar views: ""We like to value tolerance.
But you never know how tolerant you are until you're challenged on something you care about.
This issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we're not as tolerant as we pretend to be.""
 At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his officers.
 ""I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class of prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a crime,"" he said.
""All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest.
I don't want them concerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever.""
 Even before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing legislation to restrain them.
 Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column by William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil rights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: ""It is hard to believe that Bull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the treatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their treatment of members of Operation Rescue.""
 An amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and tagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community Planning and Development grants may be paid ""to any municipality that fails to adopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any individuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations.""
 Los Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989.
""This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do,"" said Gates.
""Now we've got Republicans doing it.""
 The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates pointed out.
But if this ""horrendous"" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said.
 Carol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares Gates' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative lawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause.
But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often ""barbaric,"" and she supports restraints on the police.
 Sobel was ""amused"" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.
 Still, she believes the new measure will help assure ""that the cost of demonstrating in this town doesn't escalate.
I just hope conservatives remember that it includes everyone.""

Protesters are given every chance to move on their own.
Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.
Then ""they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain.
It's a pain control technique,"" he said.
""It's going to hurt.
That's what pain-compliance means.""
 But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage.
As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.
 Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.
 ""The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,"" Nichols said.
""With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark.
It's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking.
You say, something's wrong here.""
In the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt.
Patrick E. McKinley of LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against everything from apartheid to animal rights.
Operation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.
 ""Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion,"" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.
 Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue spokeswoman called ""100% incorrect.""
 In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley.
""I'm no doctor.
But pain has a purpose.
It's telling you to stop doing what you're doing.
If you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible.""
In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta.
As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality increased: 
 * In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: ""Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.""
 * In Pittsburgh, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers.
 * In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with ""crotch carries"" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs.
A priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting pain: ""The demonic element entered in here.""
 A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: ""By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . .
'
Jesus!
Jesus!'
""
In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of ""curbside justice.""
 Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed by kindred spirits.
 ""It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent,"" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration.
""Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life.
I've never been roughed up like that before.
Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.""
 Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police.
Rather, leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
A group called Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed ""real atrocities"" by the LAPD.
But others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint.
For example, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply.
 ""I can't have much sympathy for them,"" she said of the anti-abortion ""rescuers,"" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice ""clinic defenders"" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton.
""The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous.
What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.""
At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: ""L.A. blue, we're with you.""
 Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found support.
""I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the Christians to the lions,"" he said.
In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.
 Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' fight to restrain what he calls ""the torture police.""
He also has charged that his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex issue.
 William B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, has similar views: ""We like to value tolerance.
But you never know how tolerant you are until you're challenged on something you care about.
This issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we're not as tolerant as we pretend to be.""
 At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his officers.
 ""I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class of prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a crime,"" he said.
""All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest.
I don't want them concerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever.""
 Even before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing legislation to restrain them.
 Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column by William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil rights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: ""It is hard to believe that Bull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the treatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their treatment of members of Operation Rescue.""
 An amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and tagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community Planning and Development grants may be paid ""to any municipality that fails to adopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any individuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations.""
 Los Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989.
""This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do,"" said Gates.
""Now we've got Republicans doing it.""
 The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates pointed out.
But if this ""horrendous"" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said.
 Carol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares Gates' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative lawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause.
But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often ""barbaric,"" and she supports restraints on the police.
 Sobel was ""amused"" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.
 Still, she believes the new measure will help assure ""that the cost of demonstrating in this town doesn't escalate.
I just hope conservatives remember that it includes everyone.""

 * NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL An ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police officers in Southern California.
E1.
","A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.
They press fingers under their noses.
They dig their knuckles into protesters' necks and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists.
The law enforcement name for these techniques is ""pain-compliance.""
But opponents call the term a euphemism for torture.
One man's arm is contorted behind his back until it snaps.
Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago.
Police Chief Daryl Gates stands behind the painful tactics used by his department.","[[1, 169], [171, 207], [209, 308], [534, 601], [706, 757], [482, 531], [760, 896], [2481, 2508], [3093, 3247], [3256, 3289], [14071, 14335]]"
" A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.
They press fingers under their noses.
They dig their knuckles into protesters' necks, and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists.
At one point, two officers twist a woman's arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony.
In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.
His arm, contorted behind his back, finally snaps.
 The law enforcement name for these techniques is ""pain-compliance.""
Police departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate.
But opponents call the term a euphemism for torture.
 Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago.
This time, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.
 As a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy.
Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of ""police state"" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals.
 In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as ""something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America.""
 Other conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on Nov. 15, with little media attention, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force.
Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.
 Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than $50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them.
 ""I think it's utter stupidity,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said.
""Utter, complete stupidity.""
In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used ""in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . .
all through the '60s, all through the '70s,"" Gates said.
He smiled.
""You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?""
While Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about ""chokeholds"" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that ""come-along"" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.
 His officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in the country.
On a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.
 Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: ""Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.""
 Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether ""reasonable force"" included opening fire with her handgun.
 Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt.
Fred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force.
The least forceful tactic is a simple request -- ""Would you do this?""
Pain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.
 Among the most simple ""come-along"" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said.
Another trick of the trade: the ""mastoid lift,"" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck.
Demonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.
 But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and ""go limp"" when asked to move, others link arms.
They become ""human worm-balls"" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say.
Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.
 So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a ""police control device"" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.
 To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a ""trap-and-wrap"" maneuver.
The gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.
 Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.
Protesters are given every chance to move on their own.
Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.
Then ""they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain.

 * NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL An ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police officers in Southern California.
E1.
","Los Angeles Police, in January 1990, were applying painful techniques in getting non-violent, anti-abortion protesters to comply.
These methods, twisting arms, etc., are called ""pain compliance"" techniques.
Traditional political viewpoints are reversed.
Pro-choice liberals support the police while anti-abortion republicans voice ""police state"" rhetoric.
Protesters complain that police ""come along"" holds result in serious injuries and have filed complaints.
The volatility of the abortion issue clouds the way many think about police use of force.
A police authority says restrictions on pain compliance techniques will embolden demonstrators.
An opposing view is that using pain techniques on non-violent demonstrators is barbaric.","[[72, 169], [636, 704], [898, 907], [991, 1015], [209, 308], [337, 356], [534, 599], [1109, 1182], [1199, 1430], [6160, 6409], [6411, 6463], [11327, 11453], [14071, 14335], [14546, 14703]]"
" Exxon Corp. on Wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $2 billion and said it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history.
In reporting its estimated 1989 earnings, Exxon said it would take a $500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill of 11 million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez and fouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March.
 The charges reduced Exxon's 1989 net income to $3.8 billion, compared to $5.26 billion in 1988.
Revenue totaled $96.1 billion in 1989, compared to $88.6 billion the year before.
 On Wednesday, Exxon spokesman William Smith upped the company's estimate of the spill's total costs so far -- costs to Exxon and others -- to ""about $2 billion.""
The figure does not include any liability from more than 150 lawsuits Exxon faces from the spill, nor does it include additional cleanup costs should Exxon resume work in the spring.
The fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to $880 million that the company already set aside in the first and second quarters, bringing Exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion.
Other costs will be covered by ""more than $400 million"" in insurance, Smith said.
 Analysts were not surprised at the additional charge, though ""it was a lot bigger than I expected,"" said Joel D. Fischer, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
Wall Street showed little reaction to the news, with Exxon's stock falling only 12.5 cents to close at $47 a share.
 ""The financial effect of the Exxon Valdez accident was clearly the major reason for lower net income in 1989,"" said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement.
 The charges from the Valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from a change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in federal tax law.
That raised Exxon's income by $535 million for the year.
 Without the cleanup charge and accounting gain, Exxon said its net income for the year would have been $4.7 billion, down 10.6% from 1988, despite higher oil and gas prices.
The decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing profit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations.
In the fourth quarter, earnings before the Valdez charge were $1.28 billion, compared to $1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter.
 Analysts said Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage from the charges.
""I think they did end the year on a strong note, largely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing,"" said Eugene Nowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
 Still, Exxon's stock, whose performance has lagged behind that of other major oil firms, could suffer from continuing negative publicity surrounding the Valdez spill and the subsequent spill of 567,000 gallons of heating oil into the Arthur Kill waterway between New York and New Jersey on Jan. 2.
The bad press will undoubtedly be aggravated when the criminal trial begins next week of the Exxon Valdez's captain, Joseph Hazelwood.
 Smith declined to say what costs the new $500-million charge would cover.
The previous charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots, as well as payments so far of $177 million in claims by fishermen, cannery workers and other individuals affected by the spill, said Exxon spokesman James Robertson in Anchorage.
In addition, the state of Alaska has asked Exxon to reimburse it for about $34.5 million in costs; so far, Exxon has paid the state $7.4 million in cash and has agreed to pay bills amounting to $23 million more, said the state's Oil Spill Coordinating Office.
Exxon must also reimburse the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal agencies.
Meanwhile, Exxon confirmed Wednesday that it would shut down its Denver exploration and production office, which employs about 105 people.
The office's operations will be transferred to Midland, Tex.
No decision has been made on the future of the workers in Denver, said Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in Houston.
","Exxon increased its estimate of the 1989 costs of cleaning up the most expensive environmental disaster in history to $2B and it could take another $500M. Exxon noted that these costs were the major reason for their lower net income for the year, but analysts said that Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage.

In addition, the state of Alaska has asked Exxon to reimburse it for about $34.5 million in costs; so far, Exxon has paid the state $7.4 million in cash and has agreed to pay bills amounting to $23 million more, said the state's Oil Spill Coordinating Office.
Exxon must also reimburse the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal agencies.
Meanwhile, Exxon confirmed Wednesday that it would shut down its Denver exploration and production office, which employs about 105 people.
The office's operations will be transferred to Midland, Tex.
No decision has been made on the future of the workers in Denver, said Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in Houston.
","Exxon Corp. increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $2 billion dollars and another $500 million will be taken in the fourth quarter for cleanup costs.
The figure does not include liability from more than 150 lawsuits that Exxon faces from the spill.
The fourth quarter charge is in addition to $880 million set aside in the first and second quarters, bring Exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion.
Exxon's size is said to insulate it from serious long-term financial damage.
Exxon's stock could suffer from continuing negative publicity.","[[1, 12], [26, 117], [118, 131], [353, 433], [926, 1022], [1109, 1236], [1236, 1304], [2519, 2589], [2806, 2819], [2888, 2935]]"
" Exxon Corp. on Wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $2 billion and said it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history.
In reporting its estimated 1989 earnings, Exxon said it would take a $500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill of 11 million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez and fouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March.
 The charges reduced Exxon's 1989 net income to $3.8 billion, compared to $5.26 billion in 1988.
Revenue totaled $96.1 billion in 1989, compared to $88.6 billion the year before.
 On Wednesday, Exxon spokesman William Smith upped the company's estimate of the spill's total costs so far -- costs to Exxon and others -- to ""about $2 billion.""
The figure does not include any liability from more than 150 lawsuits Exxon faces from the spill, nor does it include additional cleanup costs should Exxon resume work in the spring.
The fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to $880 million that the company already set aside in the first and second quarters, bringing Exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion.
Other costs will be covered by ""more than $400 million"" in insurance, Smith said.
 Analysts were not surprised at the additional charge, though ""it was a lot bigger than I expected,"" said Joel D. Fischer, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
Wall Street showed little reaction to the news, with Exxon's stock falling only 12.5 cents to close at $47 a share.
 ""The financial effect of the Exxon Valdez accident was clearly the major reason for lower net income in 1989,"" said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement.
 The charges from the Valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from a change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in federal tax law.
That raised Exxon's income by $535 million for the year.
 Without the cleanup charge and accounting gain, Exxon said its net income for the year would have been $4.7 billion, down 10.6% from 1988, despite higher oil and gas prices.
The decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing profit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations.
In the fourth quarter, earnings before the Valdez charge were $1.28 billion, compared to $1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter.
 Analysts said Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage from the charges.
""I think they did end the year on a strong note, largely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing,"" said Eugene Nowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
 Still, Exxon's stock, whose performance has lagged behind that of other major oil firms, could suffer from continuing negative publicity surrounding the Valdez spill and the subsequent spill of 567,000 gallons of heating oil into the Arthur Kill waterway between New York and New Jersey on Jan. 2.
The bad press will undoubtedly be aggravated when the criminal trial begins next week of the Exxon Valdez's captain, Joseph Hazelwood.
 Smith declined to say what costs the new $500-million charge would cover.
The previous charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots, as well as payments so far of $177 million in claims by fishermen, cannery workers and other individuals affected by the spill, said Exxon spokesman James Robertson in Anchorage.
In addition, the state of Alaska has asked Exxon to reimburse it for about $34.5 million in costs; so far, Exxon has paid the state $7.4 million in cash and has agreed to pay bills amounting to $23 million more, said the state's Oil Spill Coordinating Office.

","On Wednesday, Exxon announced its net earnings for 1989 at $3.8 billion, down from $5.26 billion in 1988.
This drop came even though revenue was up $7.5 billion and was attributed to the financial effect of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
The cleanup cost $1.38 billion in 1989 and Exxon expects to spend another $500 million.
Exxon still must reimburse Alaska, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other federal organizations.
Exxon stock fell by 12.5 cents, closing at $47 a share.
Its poor performance will probably continue with the bad publicity accompanying the spill and the trial of the ship's captain.","[[1, 25], [291, 307], [323, 331], [597, 604], [613, 679], [108, 117], [681, 761], [1686, 1739], [1748, 1751], [1758, 1793], [141, 182], [1247, 1304], [3576, 3627], [3670, 3675], [3720, 3730], [3823, 3896], [1621, 1642], [1648, 1682], [2806, 2819], [2821, 2856], [2888, 2951], [2959, 2964], [3097, 3172], [3183, 3212]]"

 Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin.
 ""The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free,"" British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a speech.

 Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a gesture of reconciliation with the Western members of the wartime alliance: Britain, France and the United States.
 Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit West Berlin, noted that the checkpoint was vanishing on the 49th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.
 ""The closing of this checkpoint offers further proof of a turn for the better in the international arena, for overcoming the legacy of confrontation,"" he said.
 Foreign ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and Markus Meckel of East Germany also attended the ceremony.
Genscher thanked Moscow for reform policies that had ended ""a time of trouble"" in Berlin and opened the door to unity.

" Setting aside years of animosity, the U.S. government joined with private humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine, tents, clothing, food and other relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran.
 State Department officials said the government gave $300,000 worth of supplies to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran -- including 1,000 hard hats, 1,000 pairs of leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940 wool blankets and about 500 tents.
 The U.S. military, which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in need, stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any U.S. aid requested by Iran.
However, a Pentagon official said it is unlikely that the State Department and the White House would authorize a military airlift of supplies.
 ""It's pretty clear that the Iranians don't want us, and there are so many alternatives, such as private charters, it really isn't necessary,"" the officials said.
""In a case like this, we would really be more of an irritant than a help.""
 The quake, which rocked the northern region of Iran early Thursday, left nearly 29,000 dead, by official count, and about 400,000 homeless.
The death toll is expected to rise, however, as rescuers continue work.
 Late Thursday, the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society, a Geneva-based umbrella for international humanitarian organizations.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who toured the stricken region Friday, also appealed for international aid.
 Pat Davis, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Washington, said Friday that although the Red Crescent is highly organized and well equipped, the large number of dead and suffering people has forced the Iranian agency to solicit international assistance.
 The American Red Cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit money, informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50,000 in cash to the Red Crescent Society to be used to help needy Iranians.
 Some Jewish relief organizations found themselves in an uncomfortable position because of Iran's hostility toward the United States and Israel.
Confronted with reports that Iran would not welcome assistance from Israel, the groups were uncertain whether they should offer any assistance.
 Andy Griffel, executive director of American Jewish World Service, said directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims.
 After a spirited discussion, the group decided to help but to monitor the situation closely and to be prepared to change their decision.
 ""We're a humanitarian organization . . .
without regard to political considerations,"" Griffel said.
""But if they are going politicize it, we will definitely reconsider our participation.""
 Amir Zamani, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, welcomed the ""many offers from many organizations"" that his office has received.
 ""Iran needs assistance, and such organizations are welcome to send it.""
 Acknowledging Iran's strained relations with many nations, Zamani said his country is attempting to ease the antagonism to deal with the disaster in the country.
As an example, he said ""no formalities"" will be required for relief planes flying into Iran.
 He added, however, that aid shipments will be coordinated by the government and routed through Tehran because there are no other airports in the country that can accommodate large transport planes.
 Meanwhile, other U.S. groups were rushing to supply Iran with emergency goods.
 Dwain Schenck, a relief worker for AmeriCares Foundation, said the Connecticut-based relief group expects to send 80,000 pounds of medical supplies, two doctors, a nurse and about half a dozen relief workers to Iran today.
 ""We hope to be there about four days or so,"" he said.

The government gave $300,000 of supplies, including hard hats, leather gloves, face masks, wool blankets, and tents.
Delivery of the goods would probably be by private charters rather than military transports which would normally do the job.

" As they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport, police detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby.
 When Searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him.
Within minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his suspect and pulled him to his feet.
Placing his hand across the man's mouth, the officer then marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby.
 Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration realize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that March day in 1988 was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman who was inducted Monday into Major League baseball's Hall of Fame.
 The 46-year-old Morgan, who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster, is suing Searle and the city of Los Angeles in federal court, claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain ""profile"" that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like.
 ""There's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by,"" said William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer.
 The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports.
 ""It's purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any drug activity,"" said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases.
 First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to transport narcotics.
Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics.
 Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers.
But the court said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or appearance.
 ""Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what the profile is I cannot tell you,"" said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr.
William Booth.
""It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism.
It's based on trying to protect the public.""
He said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport.
Through Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests.
 Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that his agency uses drug courier profiles.
 ""We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them,"" he said.
 Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles.
Morgan is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated.
 Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case.
But two months later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally detained by police.
 ""There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal,"" the judge concluded.
 Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did anything wrong.
 ""I wish that this hadn't happened,"" Searle said.
""I wish (Morgan) luck now that I know who he is.
I just hope I never see him again.""
 Morgan could not be reached for comment.
But in court documents, he said that on March 15, 1988, he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.
 Asked to identify himself, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him retrieve it.
When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that Searle warned the man to stay away.
 Minutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the floor.
Morgan said the officer then put a knee in his back, wrenched his arms behind him and handcuffed him.
He was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said.
Searle then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan's lawsuit.
Instead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar incidents from occurring, his attorneys said.
 ""This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person who uses Los Angeles airport,"" said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also is black.
""If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person.""
 Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss specifics of the case.
 ""All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a good announcer,"" Searle said.
""I wish it didn't happen.
He just sort of went out of control.""
 Assistant City Atty.
Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to identify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer.
 ""My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted,"" Lewis said.
""If he had cooperated, none of this would have happened.
I think he had a bruised ego, and he was offended because the officer hadn't recognized him.""
 According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier.
They said he was using an alias.
Although the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began looking for his companion.
Since the passenger was black and indicated that his companion ""looked like me,"" the officer began looking for a black man who was nervous-looking or having ""other characteristics of a narcotics courier.""
 When they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan started screaming profanities and ""making animal noises"" and hit him in the chest with a wild swing.
 In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered ""acute physical and emotional distress and embarrassment"" after the incident and expressed concern about damage to his reputation.
 RELATED STORY: C14 ","On March 15, 1988 detective Clayton Searle was at the Los Angeles International Airport looking for a drug courier.
He spotted a man making a phone call and, according to the suspect, grabbed his shoulder, spun him around and asked him to identify himself.
Then Searle grabbed the suspect by the neck, they fell to the floor, the officer put a knee on the suspect's back, and handcuffed him.
The suspect was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman.
Morgan is suing in federal court claiming that he suffered this treatment because he is black and fit a certain ""profile"" used by narcotics officers.","[[40, 76], [85, 109], [143, 155], [821, 824], [835, 847], [4179, 4193], [242, 258], [281, 284], [571, 578], [4163, 4178], [4313, 4316], [4328, 4437], [4775, 4832], [4846, 4885], [4916, 4934], [821, 847], [892, 949], [1034, 1040], [1102, 1110], [1146, 1312]]"
" As they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport, police detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby.
 When Searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him.
Within minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his suspect and pulled him to his feet.
Placing his hand across the man's mouth, the officer then marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby.
 Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration realize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that March day in 1988 was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman who was inducted Monday into Major League baseball's Hall of Fame.
 The 46-year-old Morgan, who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster, is suing Searle and the city of Los Angeles in federal court, claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain ""profile"" that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like.
 ""There's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by,"" said William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer.
 The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports.
 ""It's purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any drug activity,"" said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases.
 First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to transport narcotics.
Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics.
 Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers.
But the court said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or appearance.
 ""Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what the profile is I cannot tell you,"" said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr.
William Booth.
""It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism.
It's based on trying to protect the public.""
He said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport.
Through Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests.
 Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that his agency uses drug courier profiles.
 ""We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them,"" he said.
 Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles.
Morgan is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated.
 Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case.
But two months later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally detained by police.
 ""There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal,"" the judge concluded.
 Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did anything wrong.
 ""I wish that this hadn't happened,"" Searle said.
""I wish (Morgan) luck now that I know who he is.
I just hope I never see him again.""
 Morgan could not be reached for comment.
But in court documents, he said that on March 15, 1988, he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.
 Asked to identify himself, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him retrieve it.
When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that Searle warned the man to stay away.
 Minutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the floor.

Later, Searle realized that he had falsely arrested Joe Morgan, retired star infielder of the Cincinnati Reds.

" Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late Bernstein's catalogues.
 Executives of Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control the bulk of Bernstein's recorded legacy, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal plan to step up timetables to deliver more Bernstein recordings to the marketplace.
However, most of the repertory will be from previously released recordings, including some made early in his career.
In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month -- as originally scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon.
These are recent recordings Bernstein made with the New York Philharmonic (Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony), the Vienna Philharmonic (two Mozart symphonies and the clarinet concerto) and Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam (Schubert's Symphonies Nos. 5 and 8).
 At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of ""The Bernstein Collection"": ""We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD.""
 At Deutsche Grammophon, also in New York, Wende Persons, director of promotion, reported: ""We are looking at (Bernstein's) active DG discography, which contains over 100 different recordings, and making sure everything is available.
 That's 120 titles (of standard classical repertory) and some of Bernstein's own (non-theatrical) music, plus another dozen videos.""
In his last years, Bernstein recorded exclusively for DG.
 In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. Philharmonic.
These recordings were made between 1977 and 1985 of music by Beethoven, Brahms, Bernstein, Haydn, Mozart, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and Gershwin.
Called ""The Bernstein Edition,"" it is being sold concurrently in Europe in a 25-CD set.
 Karen Moody, vice president of the classical label, would not reveal sales figures for ""The Bernstein Edition,"" but said: ""I can say that it is selling very well in this country, surprisingly well, given the U.S. market aversion to CD sets.""
 In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in Copland's ""Billy the Kid"" and a suite from Bernstein's ""On the Town,"" recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first commercial recordings.
 BMG also plans, according to spokesman Carl Pritzkat, the spring release of an early Bernstein recording as pianist -- in which he plays Copland's Piano Variations -- as well as other recorded documents of the young composer/pianist.
 The entire Bernstein catalogue encompasses well over 200 classical recordings and occupies more than a full page in the Schwann catalogue.
 There is very little available on Bernstein in the home-video market, which is no surprise considering there are so few classical music titles on cassette.
Three tapes of programs recorded in 1971, all on Phoenix/BFA Films and Video, are out: 
 * ""Bernstein on Beethoven: a Tribute,"" featuring Bernstein playing sections of Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major.
 * ""Bernstein on Beethoven: Fidelio,"" with rehearsal and concert footage of Bernstein working with the Vienna State Opera Company.
 * ""Bernstein on Beethoven: Ode to Joy From the Ninth Symphony,"" featuring the Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic.
 Three movies whose scores he composed are also on home video: * MGM/UA's ""On the Town"" (1949), co-starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.
The lyrics are by Adolph Green and Betty Comden.
 * MGM/UA's ""West Side Story"" (1961), featuring Stephen Sondheim's lyrics.
 * RCA/Columbia's ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), the Oscar-winner for best picture.

","Expanded and accelerated release programs already have begun for recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in history.
Sony Classical will begin its three-year release of 75 CDs in January.
Deutsche Grammophon is looking at his discography.
They had released a CD set in August called ""The Bernstein Edition"", which is ""selling well.""

Beethoven programs and three movies with scores he composed.","[[1, 82], [97, 122], [407, 425], [1008, 1022], [1121, 1131], [1144, 1180], [1226, 1232], [1461, 1480], [1556, 1566], [1568, 1579], [1591, 1602], [1883, 1892], [1894, 1922], [1939, 1950], [2192, 2223], [2419, 2432], [2438, 2442], [2599, 2624], [2672, 2696], [2795, 2806], [2833, 2850], [2894, 2921], [3170, 3236], [3320, 3329], [3343, 3367], [3455, 3466], [3479, 3495], [3922, 3934], [3546, 3654], [3659, 3785], [3790, 3919], [3922, 3959]]"
" Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late Bernstein's catalogues.
 Executives of Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control the bulk of Bernstein's recorded legacy, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal plan to step up timetables to deliver more Bernstein recordings to the marketplace.
However, most of the repertory will be from previously released recordings, including some made early in his career.
In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month -- as originally scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon.
These are recent recordings Bernstein made with the New York Philharmonic (Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony), the Vienna Philharmonic (two Mozart symphonies and the clarinet concerto) and Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam (Schubert's Symphonies Nos. 5 and 8).
 At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of ""The Bernstein Collection"": ""We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD.""
 At Deutsche Grammophon, also in New York, Wende Persons, director of promotion, reported: ""We are looking at (Bernstein's) active DG discography, which contains over 100 different recordings, and making sure everything is available.
 That's 120 titles (of standard classical repertory) and some of Bernstein's own (non-theatrical) music, plus another dozen videos.""
In his last years, Bernstein recorded exclusively for DG.
 In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. Philharmonic.
These recordings were made between 1977 and 1985 of music by Beethoven, Brahms, Bernstein, Haydn, Mozart, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and Gershwin.
Called ""The Bernstein Edition,"" it is being sold concurrently in Europe in a 25-CD set.
 Karen Moody, vice president of the classical label, would not reveal sales figures for ""The Bernstein Edition,"" but said: ""I can say that it is selling very well in this country, surprisingly well, given the U.S. market aversion to CD sets.""
 In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in Copland's ""Billy the Kid"" and a suite from Bernstein's ""On the Town,"" recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first commercial recordings.
 BMG also plans, according to spokesman Carl Pritzkat, the spring release of an early Bernstein recording as pianist -- in which he plays Copland's Piano Variations -- as well as other recorded documents of the young composer/pianist.
 The entire Bernstein catalogue encompasses well over 200 classical recordings and occupies more than a full page in the Schwann catalogue.
 There is very little available on Bernstein in the home-video market, which is no surprise considering there are so few classical music titles on cassette.
Three tapes of programs recorded in 1971, all on Phoenix/BFA Films and Video, are out: 
 * ""Bernstein on Beethoven: a Tribute,"" featuring Bernstein playing sections of Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major.
 * ""Bernstein on Beethoven: Fidelio,"" with rehearsal and concert footage of Bernstein working with the Vienna State Opera Company.
 * ""Bernstein on Beethoven: Ode to Joy From the Ninth Symphony,"" featuring the Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic.
 Three movies whose scores he composed are also on home video: * MGM/UA's ""On the Town"" (1949), co-starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.
The lyrics are by Adolph Green and Betty Comden.
 * MGM/UA's ""West Side Story"" (1961), featuring Stephen Sondheim's lyrics.
 * RCA/Columbia's ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), the Oscar-winner for best picture.

","Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control most of Leonard Bernstein's recordings, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal will accelerate re-releases of Bernstein recordings.

" Queen Elizabeth II awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the coveted Order of Merit on Friday and made her husband a baronet, which is a hereditary knighthood.
 From now on Denis Thatcher will be formally addressed as Sir Denis and his wife as Lady Thatcher, although she insisted Friday she wished to be known simply as ""Mrs. Thatcher.""
 ""I have done pretty well out of being Mrs. Thatcher,"" said the former prime minister, who resigned Nov. 22 during a fight for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
 Palace insiders said Friday that one reason for the quick award of the Order of Merit, restricted to only 24 eminent men and women, was the queen's desire to demonstrate that there is no animosity between Britain's two most prominent women.
 In the past, Buckingham Palace sources and journalists assigned to the royal court have said that the two did not get along.
 ""This puts (to rest) rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didn't like each other,"" said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage and an authority on the royal family.
 As a member of the Order of Merit, created in 1902, Thatcher joins such luminaries in the world of arts, science and politics as philosopher Isiah Berlin, historian Veronica Wedgwood, writer Graham Greene, violinist Yehudi Menuhin and artist Sidney Noland, as well as honorary member Mother Teresa.
 Deceased recipients include Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, missionary Albert Schweitzer and actor Lawrence Olivier.
 Contrary to some reports, the OM, as it is popularly called
, does not precede all other British royal honors but ranks behind the Order of the Garter, which dates from 1348.
 Thatcher said she was ""deeply honored and moved"" by the award.
At the same time, the queen gave a baronetcy to Thatcher's husband Denis, the subject of fictional letters from No. 10 Downing Street invented by the satirical magazine Private Eye about life as the prime minister's consort.
 Baronets date from 1611.
Sir Denis' title passes upon his death to his son, Mark, who is married to an American, and will eventually pass to Mark Thatcher's son, Michael.
 With an OM, Thatcher can continue to serve in the House of Commons as the member from the North London constituency of Finchley.
 Burke's Brooks-Baker believes that Thatcher eventually should be made a hereditary countess, which in Britain is the female equivalent of an earl.
Traditionally, retiring prime ministers of Britain were granted earldoms, although Churchill, for one, refused a peerage, preferring to remain in the House of Commons.
","Queen Elizabeth awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the Order of Merit on Friday.
The award follows quickly on the heels of Mrs. Thatcher's resignation as prime minister.
The quickness of the award suggests that the Queen wished to show that there was no animosity between the two women.
At the same time, Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis, was awarded the hereditary knighthood of baronet.
He will be formally addressed as Sir Denis and his wife as Lady Thatcher, although she insists she wishes to be known simply as Mrs. Thatcher.

But the panel's traditional third swing vote, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Thomas was doing well.; Heflin cited the ""appearance of a confirmation conversion"" and said it may raise questions of Thomas' ""integrity and temperament.""; But Heflin added, ""I am not at this time of any firm opinion one way or the other"" on whether Thomas should be confirmed.; And Simon said Thomas' performance thus far ""has neither helped him nor hurt him.""; Specter blamed fellow committee members more than Thomas in concluding, ""We really haven't moved very far in the process.""; Thomas, a black federal appeals judge, was picked by President Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.; DeConcini said he thought the conservative Thomas ""handled the privacy questions very well"" without taking a stand on abortion.
""I don't see how you could ask him to do anything more.""; Thomas expanded earlier testimony by saying Wednesday that he believed the right of marital privacy was ""fundamental"" -- a status that accords it the fullest judicial protection from government intrusion.; But he repeatedly refused to state his views on the 1973 abortion decision based on women's right of privacy.
To give such an answer, he said, ""would undermine my ability to sit in an impartial way on such an important case.""; Thomas, who sat alone at the witness table with no notes or reference materials, also claimed a lack of familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former speeches and articles.
; That moved committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., to give Thomas a stack of the judge's past speeches so the nominee could ""help me understand them"" during future questioning.; Thomas, testifying calmly but warily, did offer fuller comment on another hot issue before the high court: prayer in public schools.
; After Simon discussed the feelings decades ago of a Jewish elementary schoolboy who left the room each day while his classmates recited a prayer, Thomas said, ""Any policy of exclusion should be considered inappropriate.
""; Outside the hearing room, abortion-rights advocates said Thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say show he would vote to ban most, if not all, abortions.; ""His most unimpressive testimony poses two equally disturbing possibilities: he is either willfully misleading the committee about his views to win confirmation, or he is a man whose convictions have shallow roots,"" said Arthur Kropp of People for the American Way.; Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he could not understand how Thomas' prior statements touching on the 1973 abortion decision could have been made without considering its content.
""I'm not satisfied with the answers,"" Leahy said.; Although Thomas appeared to back away from comments made in past speeches or articles, he told the committee, ""My view is that I have been consistent.""; Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.;
But they hope Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and Biden, Leahy, Simon and Kohl in voting against the nominee.; Biden and Kennedy declined comment Wednesday on their leanings.;
Metzenbaum said Thomas' refusal to give direct answers ""makes it more difficult to vote for him.""; THOMAS' VIEWS; Excerpts from Clarence Thomas' testimony:; On abortion: ""I have no reason or agenda to prejudge the issue . . .
or a predilection to rule one way or another on the issue of abortion.

""; On natural law: ""At no time did I feel, nor do I feel now, that natural law is anything more than the background to our Constitution.""; HEAR IT, SEE IT; Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas are scheduled to run through Friday this week and every weekday except Wednesday next week.; RADIO; (box) KQED, 88.5 FM Tape delay beginning at 9 a.m.; repeated at 9:30 p.m.; (box) KPFA, 94.1 FM Live coverage begins at 6:30 a.m.; TELEVISION; (box) C-SPAN Live coverage begins at 7 a.m.; repeated at 5 p.m.; (box) CNN Intermittent coverage.","Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is evasive, but no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation is emerging.

"Flexing its muscles as a cartel, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month.
The South African concern, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization, sells a vast array of diamonds, varying in quality and size, dealers say.
So the increase could be as much as 20% on top-grade diamonds.
The rise follows an average price increase of 14.5% last year.
""The diamond price increase was expected,"" said Jacques Zucker, of Lachowsky Zucker, diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.
By changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said.
""Few listened to us two years ago when we advised clients to buy diamonds at depressed values,"" Mr. Zucker said.
""Now they must accept higher prices.""
""The price rise provides the necessary psychological lift to the market,"" said Peter Miller, a mining analyst at Shearson Lehman Securities in London.
It will help the diamond producers ""consolidate their gains.""
Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of the year, dealers said.
In 1985, at the low point of a deep slump, a top quality stone was $8,500 a carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980.
A carat equals 200 milligrams.
De Beers decided to raise prices because rough diamonds were already trading at a premium over its own quotes on the open market, said Andrew Lamont, a company spokesman.
Demand is especially buoyant in the Far East.
In the first seven months of 1987, Japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added.
After the U.S., Japan is the second biggest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany.
Only one out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings less than two decades ago; now more than two-thirds buy.
""The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of diamonds for Japanese buyers,"" Mr. Lamont says.
Stronger currencies and lower interest rates in West Germany and other European countries also boosted diamond sales, he says.
Diamonds are priced in U.S. dollars.
Demand for polished diamonds in the U.S., Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, and the Philippines also raised exports of the leading diamond cutting and dealing centers, primarily Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York.
To meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade, De Beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986.
Sales of $2.56 billion last year were the highest since the 1980 boom when De Beers turnover reached $2.72 billion.
Analysts are predicting sales of $3 billion in 1987.
Yet some dealers worry because world diamond production surged to 89.6 million carats last year from 47 million carats in 1982.
Only about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say.
De Beers surprised skeptics and revived trade from the slump in the first half of the decade by withholding stocks and pursuing an intensive marketing campaign.
An advertising and promotion budget which rose to $110 million this year from $43 million in 1980 helped raise world-wide sales of diamond jewelry to a record 49 million pieces valued at $24.6 billion last year.
In 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says.
In more than half a century of its existence, the Central Selling Organization, which includes as members black African state producers, has outlasted other commodity cartels by never cutting diamond prices.
The cartel controls most of the world's rough diamond market via a ""pipeline"" that stretches from mines in Africa to Australia to diamond dealers and cutters.","Next month the Central Selling Organization of De Beers is raising its diamond prices by an average of ten percent.
The price of a one-carat D-flawless diamond has risen from 12,000 to 14,000 in the past eight months.

De Beers decided to raise prices because of the higher demand for diamonds, particularly in Japan.

"Who is this man a multi-million dollar ad campaign and a senator from Massachusetts said would turn back the clock on civil rights to the days of segregated lunch counters?
Who is this man who would want to reopen such old national wounds?
Robert Bork was the young associate in a Chicago law firm who in 1957 demanded that the partners end their Jewish quota and hire Howard Krane.
Mr. Krane is now a senior partner there, and told the Judiciary Committee that ""Bob Bork is a person without prejudice against any group.""
U.S. Solicitor General Bork was quick to rescue Jewel Lafontant, the first black woman to be a deputy in that office, when she told him of her exclusion from meetings due to her sex.
""The very next day was the beginning of my attending so many briefings,"" Ms. Lafontant told the senators, ""I wondered to myself whether I had been wise in complaining.""
The deeds of Robert Bork in his personal life are matched by the words of his professional duties as appeals court judge and solicitor general.
The evidence is that the distortions of Mr. Bork's civil-rights record are nothing more -- or less -- than a grotesque lie.
--Record as Appeals Judge.
Bork opponents have tried to substitute result-oriented statistics for careful analysis of his legal reasoning to impugn Judge Bork as anti-women, pro-business, etc.
Yet even on the basis of the opposition's anti-intellectual methods, Judge Bork's civil-rights record is clear.
In his five years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Judge Bork has heard eight cases involving the rights of minorities or women -- and ruled in their favor in seven.
In no case did he render an opinion less sympathetic to minority or women's rights than the Supreme Court.
Perhaps even more telling, his opinions are among the circuit's most notable civil-rights rulings.
In this year's Emory v. Secretary of the Navy, Judge Bork ruled for a black Navy captain who wanted to sue the promotions board.
The issue was whether the military branches are subject to judicial review where civil rights are at stake.
Judge Bork held for the first time that federal courts can decide these cases.
Also this year, in Doe v. Weinberger, Judge Bork held that a plaintiff fired from the National Security Agency due to his homosexuality was illegally denied a hearing.
Judge Bork has written or joined several opinions protecting women's rights, especially at work: Laffey v. Northwest Airlines (1984) demanded that stewardesses get paid as much as male pursers for comparable work; Palmer v. Shultz (1987) held for women foreign service officers alleging discrimination by the State Department in assignments and promotions; and Ososky v. Wick (1983) reversed the lower court to bring women in the Foreign Service under Equal Pay Act protections.
--Record as Solicitor General.
When the critics ask, where was Robert Bork during the great civil-rights victories?
the best answer is that he was standing in front of the Supreme Court making the winning arguments.
Indeed, perhaps the best measure of Robert Bork's civil-rights record is his four years as the government's chief litigator.
Solicitors general have great freedom to file briefs weighing the claims of private parties in cases where they are not required to act as the government's defense lawyer.
Mr. Bork used his position to argue more pro-civil rights cases than any Supreme Court nominee since Thurgood Marshall.
In 17 of the 19 cases, Solicitor General Bork argued for the civil rights plaintiff or minority interest; the NAACP Legal Defense Fund was on his side in nine of the 10 cases where both filed briefs.
Indeed, perhaps the most lasting accomplishment of his solicitor generalship in the mid-1970s was building on the civil rights gains of the 1960s.
He was ahead of the times in 1976 in Runyon v. McCrary.
The issue was whether private schools can deny admission to blacks.
This controversial case raised the conflict between the freedom of private groups to set their own rules and the public goal of non-discrimination.
The civil-rights law, Solicitor General Bork said, ""reaches the actions of private individuals not in any way facilitated by state law.""
The Supreme Court agreed, with Lewis Powell dissenting.
In several cases, Solicitor General Bork took the controversial position that plaintiffs do not have to prove the defendant's discriminatory intent in order to win discrimination cases.
Black workers brought the 1975 case of Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody against their employer and their union.
They argued that they had been locked into low-paying jobs by testing policies and union rules.
Mr. Bork successfully argued that even if the employer didn't mean to discriminate against black workers, the mere existence of a discriminatory effect entitled the plaintiffs to back pay.
Solicitor General Bork tried to take the law even further.
In the 1977 case of Teamsters v. U.S., the Supreme Court refused to accept his argument that a wholly race-neutral seniority system is unlawful if it perpetuates discriminatory effects.
Despite Judge Bork's record of public service to civil rights, Sen. Joseph Biden claimed that ""throughout his career, Judge Bork has opposed virtually every civil rights advance.""
How can this be?
The critics cite Mr. Bork's speculative academic writings -- yet distort even these: --Brown v. Board of Education.
Whatever Sen. Biden was referring to, it couldn't have been the landmark Supreme Court case that desegregated the public schools and gave courage to a politically deadlocked Congress to act on civil rights.
Judge Bork has said that by the 1954 Brown case, ""it had become abundantly apparent through repeated litigation that separate was never equal.""
This isn't a recent conversion: In a 1968 Fortune article, he called the ruling ""surely correct.""
In his 1971 Indiana Law Review article, then-Yale Prof. Bork said that the 14th Amendment ""was intended to enforce a core idea of black equality against governmental discrimination.""
At a Federalist Society meeting this past January, Judge Bork defended Brown's reasoning against critics who insisted that the 14th Amendment was not intended to prohibit segregated schools.
He said, ""To have chosen separation rather than equality would have been to read the equal protection clause out of the Constitution.""
Judge Bork calls Brown ""perhaps the greatest moral achievement of our constitutional law.""
--Public Accommodations.
Much has been made of Mr. Bork's three-page article in The New Republic in 1963 making the libertarian case against government-coerced desegregation of private establishments.
Unlike the segregationists, he was not motivated by a desire for racial separation.
Indeed, he stipulated that ""of the ugliness of racial discrimination there need be no argument.""
Instead, his purpose was to warn against the dangers of government intervention into private relations even for a cause as noble as desegregation.
""It is sad to have to defend the principle of freedom in this context,"" he wrote, ""but the task ought not to be left to those Southern politicians who only a short while ago were defending laws that enforced racial segregation.""
Robert Bork long ago rejected the extreme libertarian argument.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ""did an enormous amount to bring the country together and bring blacks into the mainstream,"" he said at his 1973 confirmation hearings as solicitor general.
""That is the way I should have judged the statute in the first place instead of on these abstract libertarian principles.""
Does this sound like someone who would undo racial progress?
--Voting Rights.
Critics of Judge Bork make the startling claim that he favors poll taxes, the device once used to deny blacks their right to vote.
Judge Bork told the Judiciary Committee that he has ""no desire to bring poll taxes back into existence.
I do not like them myself.""
He has criticized Harper v. Virginia Board of Education, the 1966 case that invalidated state poll taxes.
But the case had nothing to do with race.
The high court in Harper explicitly said that there was no evidence of any racially discriminatory application of the $1.50 poll tax.
Judge Bork told the committee that if the tax had been ""applied in a discriminatory fashion, it would have clearly been unconstitutional.""
Judge Bork's point was that if there is no racial discrimination, then there can be no equal-protection-clause justification to invalidate a state poll tax.
The 24th Amendment, he noted, prohibited only federal poll taxes, intentionally leaving states free to assess such taxes if they chose.
Judge Bork has said that a better ground for invalidating a poll tax would be if it were so high an amount that it interfered with the constitutional provision guaranteeing a republican form of government.
Apart from Judge Bork's extraordinary civil-rights record, there is a strong argument that minorities above all others should demand judicial restraint and an honest reading of the Constitution and its civil rights amendments.
If justices of the William Brennan variety can make the Constitution mean what they like it to mean, the Supreme Court becomes another branch of government subject to buffeting by public opinion.
The history of activist judges until recently is a history of black oppression; justices in Plessey v. Ferguson (1896) ignored the text of the 14th Amendment to create separate but equal.
Judges such as Robert Bork insist that the law adhere to the Constitution, preserving a text that protects minority rights that today could again lose popularvor.
A reading of Judge Bork's voluminous cvil rights record leaves the inescapable conclusion that the partisan campaign against him was one of intentional distortion.
If only the special interests had shown a fraction of the compassion for the truth as Robert Bork has shown for minorities.
As it is, senators who take the time to review his record will find no honest argument that minorities or women have anything to fear from a Justice Bork.
--- Mr. Crovitz is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page.","Distortions of Judge Bork's unambiguous civil-rights record are a lie.
As an Appellate Judge for the District of Columbia, never did he render an opinion less sympathetic to minority or women's rights than the Supreme Court.
Furthermore, his opinions are among the circuit's most notable rulings.
As Solicitor General Bork argued more pro- civil rights cases than any Supreme Court nominee since Thurgood Marshall.
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund supported him in 9 of the 10 cases where they both filed briefs.
Yet, Senator Biden claims, ""Throughout his career, Judge Bork has opposed virtually every civil rights advance.""

"Though the forms for the 1990 census are already at the printers, Congress is contemplating adding a question: Are you an illegal immigrant?
The Census Bureau, as it has in the past, is planning to count all residents of the nation regardless of legal status.
But the Senate already has voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment.
A majority of the members of the House of Representatives has signaled support.
""It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced,"" Rep. Thomas Petri (R., Wis.) said in a recent House debate.
Replied Rep. Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.): ""A very clear reading of the Constitution says that we shall count all those who are present.""
Although the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments, it's largely driven by geography.
Wisconsin has few illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots.
""It boils down to regional politics,"" says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants.
Counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the House for Pennsylvania and one more for California, according to the private Population Reference Bureau.
The Census Bureau's chief antagonist in the Senate, Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), says seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina and Alabama also are at risk.
On the other hand, Texas, Florida and New York could benefit.
""Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans,"" says David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
The Census Bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in California.
That meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia.
""You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals,"" says Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.), who leads the charge against the practice in the House.
Organizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign.
They fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the Census Bureau already faces in accurately counting Hispanics and blacks.
""As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential,"" Mr. Vargas says.
""If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder.""
The Census Bureau agrees.
""We tell people: Put your name down on the census form.
We won't report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants},"" says Peter Bonpanne, an assistant director.
""If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody's legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people's participation.""
Although the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if Congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, Mr. Bonpanne says.
The bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens.
To satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen.
Rep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems.
""We're spending billions on the census, and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly-aching about how difficult it will be,"" he complains.
""The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power . . .
not to gather demographic information.""
The Senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment.
Because California, Texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the House, the House has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants.
The House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from ""knowingly"" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds.
All sides in the debate predict a lawsuit no matter what Congress does.
In 1980, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court decision throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from counting illegal immigrants.
A similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in Pittsburgh ruled that the states that sued -- Pennsylvania, Kansas and Alabama -- couldn't show they had been harmed.
The Constitution simply calls for apportioning the House on the basis of the ""the whole number of persons"" in each state.
The Constitution originally called for counting ""free persons"" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person.
That was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868.
Only ""Indians not taxed"" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940.
Much of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word ""person"" in references to the census.
Elsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word ""citizen.""
They wrote, for instance, that only those who have been ""seven years a citizen of the United States"" can serve in the House.
The word ""person"" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War.
Those in Congress and at the Census Bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the U.S. conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate.

"The results need to be replicated by other researchers before definitive conclusions can be made, and the long-term effect of the treatment remains unknown.
But the initial experience with the compound is especially promising, and an apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease, scientists said.
""There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years,"" says Lawrence Piro, chief of cancer research at Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation, La Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed.
""The leukemia hasn't come back in any of the patients we treated.""
The study is published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
""It is without doubt the most effective treatment for hairy-cell leukemia, in terms of rapidity of response,"" adds Elihu H. Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.
Dr. Estey recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had similar results with five patients.
""It's a striking finding,"" he says.
""It's very unlikely to be a fluke.""
Hairy-cell leukemia, so-called because of the appearance of the cancerous cells under the microscope, affects about 6,000 people in the U.S., with 600 new cases a year.
As the disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions.
Until the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and patients often died of blood problems and infections.
Since then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia.
Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. of Switzerland.
But neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea, vomiting, skin rashes and nervous-system disorders, researchers say.
""With the lack of toxicity and the ease with which people go into remission {with 2-CdA}, I think there's something really going on here,"" says Ellin Berman, a staff leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York.
Scripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., to produce and distribute 2-CdA to other centers for broader clinical trials.
The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer treatments.
In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA, short for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, was administered continuously for seven days to patients aged 36 to 61.
Within eight to 10 weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their blood or bone marrow; the 12th had a small amount remaining in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow monitoring, Dr. Piro said.
His blood tests are normal, Dr. Piro added.
None of the patients have had a relapse; complete remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment, according to the study.
""When you can make all the disease go away with a single infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to be cured,"" Dr. Piro said.
But because hairy-cell leukemia proliferates slowly, a relapse could occur long after treatment.
Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether 2-CdA actually cures the disease.
The drug was first made about 10 years ago at Scripps by Dennis A. Carson, who studied severe combined immunodeficiency disease, made famous a few years ago by the Texas boy that lived in a bubble.
People with that disease lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine, a chemical that, without the enzyme, builds up in infection-fighting white blood cells and kills them.
Since cancer patients have the enzyme, Scripps scientists developed a compound that mimics deoxyadenosine, but tricks the enzyme so it can't be processed.
The compound then kills the white blood cells, including those that are cancerous.
New, normal white cells are then generated in the bone marrow.
Because hairy-cell leukemia is rare, a 12-patient study ""is considered a pretty good series,"" says Sloan-Kettering's Dr. Berman.
""It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments.""
Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
About 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said.
""Now, we will use {2-CdA} as a first treatment to see if response and remission are higher,"" he said.
Meanwhile, researchers at University of California at San Francisco are testing 2-CdA on AIDS-related lymphoma.","A new cancer drug called 2-CdA proved nearly 100% effective treating 12 patients with hairy cell leukemia.
The patients underwent just a seven day treatment and suffered almost none of the usual debilitating side effects associated with chemotherapy, yet, they have been disease free for four years.
Results must be replicated by other researchers before definitive conclusions can be made.
The drug is easy to produce and likely to be less expensive.
Dr. Lawrence Piro of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation said it has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common forms of leukemia.","[[757, 800], [2529, 2559], [2595, 2611], [2667, 2764], [2554, 2559], [2595, 2611], [2625, 2651], [2926, 2955], [0, 96], [2431, 2498], [460, 517], [524, 543], [4356, 4493], [4517, 4546]]"

Those with a high risk are people with defenses weakened by HIV infection, other serious illnesses, or poor nutrition.","[[565, 580], [655, 679], [0, 77], [119, 126], [145, 212], [0, 3], [11, 21], [30, 32], [56, 77], [131, 143], [214, 228], [241, 275], [289, 297], [214, 228], [457, 488], [494, 514], [0, 3], [11, 21], [30, 32], [154, 212], [263, 275], [299, 302], [319, 353], [377, 387], [553, 602], [750, 796], [798, 816], [836, 897], [906, 913], [931, 944], [972, 987], [1004, 1006], [1010, 1024]]"
"The health department said it is providing tuberculosis testing and treatment for the Human Resources Administration's program for the homeless, and will train staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control.
The department also has an established residence for homeless tuberculosis patients, and is working with substance-abuse treatment services to extend tuberculosis prevention in its programs.
The Board of Health approved a resolution last year requiring all children entering city schools to be tested.
The Health Department estimates that one million New Yorkers may be infected by the TB germ.
But only a fraction of a percent of those who have active tuberculosis disease can spread the infection to susceptible individuals.
The germ is inactive in more than 99% of those infected.
Those at high risk for contracting TB are people whose capacity for resisting infection is weakened, either through diseases such as HIV infection, by drug or alcohol abuse, serious illness such as cancer, or by poor nutrition.
The greatest concentration of tuberculosis was in the 25-to-44 age group, accounting for 57% of the total.
Men outnumber women two to one in the caseload.","Incidence of active TB rose 38% in New York in 1990 according to the Health Commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers.
The city is responding with tuberculosis clinics and increased funding for prevention and intervention, including TB testing for homeless, housing for those found positive, increased preventive measures for drug abusers and testing for children entering school.
They estimate one million New Yorkers may be infected by the TB germ; but it is inactive in 99%.
Those at high risk are those whose capacity to resist infection is impaired, such as those with HIV, substance abusers, cancer or poor nutrition.","[[0, 77], [127, 143], [177, 212], [253, 297], [319, 353], [357, 387], [457, 514], [565, 576], [516, 607], [741, 796], [798, 816], [836, 897], [923, 970], [996, 1002], [1004, 1006], [1010, 1024]]"
